        "prompt": "On October 6, 2022, an incident occurred at the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP) Unit 3 involving the automatic actuation of the Reactor Protection System during the restoration of the Division B Class 1E DC and Uninterruptible Power Supply system. The incident was triggered when the breaker for the Unit 3 Division B 24-hour DC distribution panel was opened as part of a lineup to establish initial conditions in accordance with the associated System Operating Procedure (SOP). This action resulted in a loss of power to Division B-powered safety-related air-operated valves, which caused the valves to reposition to their fail-safe, loss-of-power safety positions. Specifically, the Passive Residual Heat Removal Heat Exchanger Outlet Flow Control Valve (3-PXS-V108B) failed open, generating a Reactor Trip signal. The root cause of the event was identified as inadequate procedural guidance. The incident influenced the operation of Division B-powered air-operated valves, but VEGP Units 1, 2, and 4 were unaffected. Operators responded promptly using approved procedures and successfully restored power to the Division B 24-hour DC distribution panel. As a corrective action, procedure 3-IDSB-SOP-001 was revised to enhance the separation of the 24-hour and 72-hour battery system alignments. A review of historical records revealed no similar events within the past three years. The operators adhered to the existing System Operating Procedure (SOP) during the event, and improvements were made to procedural guidance to prevent recurrence.",

        "prompt": "On April 10, 2023, the Reactor Protection System at the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP) Unit 3 automatically actuated due to low reactor coolant flow during main generator testing activities. Operators promptly responded by stabilizing the plant and removing decay heat using the steam generator power-operated relief valves. The cause of the event was identified as an incorrect turbine control valve logic setting, which resulted in inadequate turbine speed and generator voltage. This issue led to a reduction in the speed and output voltage of the main generator, subsequently causing a decrease in the speed of the Reactor Coolant Pumps. The reduced reactor coolant flow rate triggered the automatic Reactor Protection System actuation. Corrective actions included adjusting the turbine control valve logic setting to ensure sufficient valve openings to maintain turbine speed and generator output voltage during island mode operation. A software design change increased the turbine control valve setting from 7 percent to 25 percent to address this issue. The procedure being conducted at the time of the event was '3-ZAS-MEM-002, Main Generator Initial Synchronization Testing.' No similar events have occurred in the past three years.",

        "prompt": "On July 25, 2022, with both Surry Power Station Units 1 and 2 at 100% power, the 7-day Technical Specification (TS) Allowed Outage Time (AOT) for an emergency diesel generator (EDG) was exceeded due to a partial loss of load during monthly surveillance testing for the Unit 1 emergency diesel generator (EDG-1), requiring repair and restoration. To complete the EDG-1 repair, balancing, testing, and return to service, a request for enforcement discretion was submitted and approved that extended the TS AOT by two days (for a total of nine days). During event troubleshooting, it was revealed that the cause was corrosion between the lugs of the field lead causing a hard ground on one pole of the generator rotor. The risk analysis performed for this event concluded that the increase in core damage and large early release probability remained within the NRC Enforcement Manual limits. Completed corrective actions included the replacement of the EDG-1 generator and verification of operability of the EDG-2 and EDG-3.",

        "prompt": "On February 26, 2023, an oil leak developed at the outlet coupling connection of the circulating lube oil pump for the 1B Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG), rendering the generator inoperable. This issue was preceded by a similar leak on November 4, 2022, which occurred following the replacement of a flexible coupling on the same EDG. The root causes were identified as inadequate restraints on the piping, which allowed movement and led to a failure of the lube oil pressure boundary, and deficiencies in the troubleshooting process during the initial incident in November 2022. The lack of robust implementation and documentation in the troubleshooting process contributed to the recurrence of the issue. The inoperability of the 1B EDG persisted from December 7, 2022, to March 3, 2023, during which the generator was vulnerable to initiating events that could adversely affect its ability to supply emergency power. Corrective actions included modifying the existing lube oil pipe restraint and installing a new, additional restraint. The issue was ultimately resolved by replacing the flexible coupling with rigid piping. Furthermore, procedures were revised to define roles, responsibilities, and required documentation more clearly for responding to issues, troubleshooting, and implementing corrective actions for similar deficiencies. A related event occurred on November 4, 2022, following the replacement of the flexible coupling on the 1B EDG.",

        "prompt": "On October 18, 2023, an actuation of the A Train Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) pump occurred while Unit 1 was in Mode 5 during a planned refueling outage. Maintenance technicians were performing PT/0/A/4600/012 A (Train A Reactor Trip Breakers Actuating Device Operational Test for Manual Trip Function) and removed the incorrect fuse in the 1A Solid State Protection System (SSPS) cabinet, temporarily deenergizing Train A SSPS Slave Relays. This caused the 1A AFW Auto-Start Defeat circuit to reset, and in turn, start the 1A AFW pump. The Automatic Recirculation Valve (ARV) provided the required flow path for pump protection. Auxiliary Feedwater was not supplied to the respective Steam Generators due to the motor operated discharge isolation valves (MOVs) being closed as required for current plant conditions. At the time of the 1A AFW actuation, the Main Feedwater (MFW) pumps were in a tripped condition, and decay heat removal was being provided by the 1A Residual Heat Removal (RHR) System. Both MFW pumps being in tripped status provided the logic for the AFW actuation signal once the 1A AFW Auto-Start Defeat circuit was reset. Corrective actions included personnel accountability and reinforcement of human performance tools.",
