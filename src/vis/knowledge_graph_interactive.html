Abstract (Limit to 1 560 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced typewritten lines) On October 24, 2022, Vogtle Unit 3 identified that Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.9.2.1 to \"Verify one valve in each unborated water source flow path is secured in the closed position,\" was not met, placing the unit in Technical Specification Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.9.2 Condition A. The Demineralized Water Supply Containment Isolation valve 3-DWS-V244 was open, having previously been removed from procedure 3-RCS-OTS-20-001, \"Unborated Water Source Checklist,\" without adding adequate requirements for alternate isolation valves in the Chemical and Volume Control system. LCO Required Action A.1, to initiate actions to secure one valve in the flow path in the closed position, was performed immediately and Required Action A.2 was performed within 4 hours. The apparent cause of this event was that the procedure to perform SR 3.9.2.1 (3-RCS-OTS-20-001) was inadequate in ensuring unborated water sources were properly isolated. The immediate corrective action was to close and secure the valve in the flow path. Procedure 3-RCS-OTS-20-001 was revised to add the missing unborated water isolation valves. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as an operation or condition prohibited by the plant\u0027s Technical Specifications. VEGP Units 1, 2, and 4 were unaffected during this event.

FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET NUMBER 3. LER NUMBER YEAR SEQUENTIAL REV 1Vogtle Electric Generating Plant, Unit 3 05000- NUMBER NO. \"05200025\" 2022 003 00 NARRATIVE EVENT DESCRIPTION On October 24, 2022, at 0815 EDT with the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP) Unit 3 at 0% power, in Mode 6 after completion of the initial fuel load, Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.9.2.1 verifying that one valve in each unborated water source flow path is secured in the closed position was not met. Specifically, 3-DWS-V244 Demineralized Water Supply Containment Isolation valve [El IS: KJ / ISV] was in the open position, resulting in an unborated water source flow path without one valve verified secured in the closed position. LCO Required Action A.1, to initiate actions to secure one valve in the flow path in the closed position, was performed immediately, and Required Action A.2, verify boron concentration is within the limit specified in the COLR, was performed within 4 hours. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as operation or condition prohibited by the plant\u0027s Technical Specifications (TS). The condition prohibited by the TS began when the unit entered Mode 6 on October 13, 2022, at 2354 hours and exited on October 25, 2022, at 1411 hours. EVENT ANALYSIS The cause of this event is inadequate procedure 3-RCS-OTS-20-001, \"Unborated Water Source Checklist,\" which is the unborated water sources surveillance procedure required to be performed in accordance with SR 3.9.2.1 to verify proper isolation of each unborated water source flow path. Specifically, the dilution flow path was no longer accounted for due to a previous change to procedure 3-RCS-OTS-20-001. REPORTABILITY AND SAFETY ASSESSMENT There were no safety consequences due to this event because the boron concentration requirements of TS 3.9.1, \"Boron Concentration,\" were met. No radiological release occurred due to this event. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as an operation or condition prohibited by the plant\u0027s Technical Specifications. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS COMPLETED Procedure 3-RCS-OTS-20-001, \"Unborated Water Source Checklist\", was revised to add additional unborated water isolations.

Abstract (Limit to 1 560 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced typewritten lines) On October 24, 2022, Vogtle Unit 3 identified that Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.9.2.1 to \"Verify one valve in each unborated water source flow path is secured in the closed position,\" was not met, placing the unit in Technical Specification Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.9.2 Condition A. The Demineralized Water Supply Containment Isolation valve 3-DWS-V244 was open, having previously been removed from procedure 3-RCS-OTS-20-001, \"Unborated Water Source Checklist,\" without adding adequate requirements for alternate isolation valves in the Chemical and Volume Control system. LCO Required Action A.1, to initiate actions to secure one valve in the flow path in the closed position, was performed immediately and Required Action A.2 was performed within 4 hours. The apparent cause of this event was that the procedure to perform SR 3.9.2.1 (3-RCS-OTS-20-001) was inadequate in ensuring unborated water sources were properly isolated. The immediate corrective action was to close and secure the valve in the flow path. Procedure 3-RCS-OTS-20-001 was revised to add the missing unborated water isolation valves. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as an operation or condition prohibited by the plant\u0027s Technical Specifications. VEGP Units 1, 2, and 4 were unaffected during this event.

LER NUMBER YEAR SEQUENTIAL REV 1Vogtle Electric Generating Plant, Unit 3 05000- NUMBER NO. \"05200025\" 2022 003 00 NARRATIVE EVENT DESCRIPTION On October 24, 2022, at 0815 EDT with the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP) Unit 3 at 0% power, in Mode 6 after completion of the initial fuel load, Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.9.2.1 verifying that one valve in each unborated water source flow path is secured in the closed position was not met. Specifically, 3-DWS-V244 Demineralized Water Supply Containment Isolation valve [El IS: KJ / ISV] was in the open position, resulting in an unborated water source flow path without one valve verified secured in the closed position. LCO Required Action A.1, to initiate actions to secure one valve in the flow path in the closed position, was performed immediately, and Required Action A.2, verify boron concentration is within the limit specified in the COLR, was performed within 4 hours. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as operation or condition prohibited by the plant\u0027s Technical Specifications (TS). The condition prohibited by the TS began when the unit entered Mode 6 on October 13, 2022, at 2354 hours and exited on October 25, 2022, at 1411 hours. EVENT ANALYSIS The cause of this event is inadequate procedure 3-RCS-OTS-20-001, \"Unborated Water Source Checklist,\" which is the unborated water sources surveillance procedure required to be performed in accordance with SR 3.9.2.1 to verify proper isolation of each unborated water source flow path. Specifically, the dilution flow path was no longer accounted for due to a previous change to procedure 3-RCS-OTS-20-001. REPORTABILITY AND SAFETY ASSESSMENT There were no safety consequences due to this event because the boron concentration requirements of TS 3.9.1, \"Boron Concentration,\" were met. No radiological release occurred due to this event. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as an operation or condition prohibited by the plant\u0027s Technical Specifications. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS COMPLETED Procedure 3-RCS-OTS-20-001, \"Unborated Water Source Checklist\", was revised to add additional unborated water isolations.

Abstract (Limit to 1326 spaces, i.e , approximately 13 single-spaced typewritten lines) On April 10, 2023, at 0048 EDT with Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP) Unit 3 in Mode 1 at 18 percent power, the reactor protection system was automatically actuated due to low reactor coolant flow while conducting main generator testing activities. The operators responded timely by stabilizing the plant and removing decay heat by the steam generator power operated relief valves. The cause of the event was incorrect turbine control valve logic setting which resulted in inadequate turbine speed and generator voltage. The corrective action for this event adjusted the turbine control valve logic setting to open the valves sufficiently to maintain turbine speed and generator output voltage to support house loads during operation in island mode (with the generator disconnected from the grid and supplying unit auxiliary loads). This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as a condition that resulted in automatic actuation of the reactor protection system, which tripped the reactor.

LER NUMBER 0  050 YEAR SEQUENTIAL REV Vogtle Electric Generating Plant, Unit 3 00025 NUMBER NO. 2023 0 052 003 00 NARRATIVE EVENT DESCRIPTION On April 10, 2023, at 0048 EDT with the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP) Unit 3 in Mode 1 at 18 percent power, the Reactor Protection System (RPS) [EllS: JC] was automatically actuated during main generator system [EIIS: EL] startup testing. While performing procedure 3-ZAS-MEM-002, \"Main Generator Initial Synchronization Testing,\" with the main generator connected to the offsite power grid and supplying approximately 65 Megawatts (MW), the switchyard breakers [EIIS: FK / BKR] ZBS-161750 and ZBS-161850 were opened to disconnect the main generator from the offsite power grid and place the generator into island mode (supplying unit auxiliary loads). Shortly after placing the main generator in island mode, the turbine control system [EIIS: JJ] was not able to automatically maintain speed at the required 1800 rpm. This caused a reduction of speed and output voltage from the main generator, which resulted in a reduction in the speed of the Reactor Coolant Pumps [EIIS: AB / P]. This caused reduction in the reactor coolant flowrate, which resulted in the automatic RPS actuation. There were no structures, systems, or components that were inoperable at the beginning of the event that contributed to the event. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as a condition that resulted in automatic actuation of the RPS. EVENT ANALYSIS The cause of this event was an incorrect turbine control valve setting, which was not identified through oversight of legacy design. The turbine control valve high limit setting was not set to maintain house loads during island mode operation. The turbine control valve high limit setting was set at 7 percent, which was a default value for turbine speed control and was not sufficient to support island mode operation. The software was changed to increase the high limit setting from 7 to 25 percent to support island mode operation. SAFETY ASSESSMENT There were no safety consequences due to this event because the automatic actuation function of the RPS maintained the plant in a safe condition. The operators responded timely following the reactor trip by ensuring plant stability and decay heat was removed by steam generator power operated relief valves [EIIS: SB / PCV]. All safety systems functioned as expected as a result of the event. There were no equipment failures that contributed to the event. VEGP Units 1, 2, and 4 were unaffected by this event. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS The turbine control valve setting was corrected by a software design change to increase the setting from 7 to 25 percent.

Abstract (Limit to 1 560 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced typewritten lines) On October 24, 2022, Vogtle Unit 3 identified that Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.9.2.1 to \"Verify one valve in each unborated water source flow path is secured in the closed position,\" was not met, placing the unit in Technical Specification Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.9.2 Condition A. The Demineralized Water Supply Containment Isolation valve 3-DWS-V244 was open, having previously been removed from procedure 3-RCS-OTS-20-001, \"Unborated Water Source Checklist,\" without adding adequate requirements for alternate isolation valves in the Chemical and Volume Control system. LCO Required Action A.1, to initiate actions to secure one valve in the flow path in the closed position, was performed immediately and Required Action A.2 was performed within 4 hours. The apparent cause of this event was that the procedure to perform SR 3.9.2.1 (3-RCS-OTS-20-001) was inadequate in ensuring unborated water sources were properly isolated. The immediate corrective action was to close and secure the valve in the flow path. Procedure 3-RCS-OTS-20-001 was revised to add the missing unborated water isolation valves. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as an operation or condition prohibited by the plant\u0027s Technical Specifications. VEGP Units 1, 2, and 4 were unaffected during this event.

LER NUMBER YEAR SEQUENTIAL REV 1Vogtle Electric Generating Plant, Unit 3 05000- NUMBER NO. \"05200025\" 2022 003 00 NARRATIVE EVENT DESCRIPTION On October 24, 2022, at 0815 EDT with the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP) Unit 3 at 0% power, in Mode 6 after completion of the initial fuel load, Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.9.2.1 verifying that one valve in each unborated water source flow path is secured in the closed position was not met. Specifically, 3-DWS-V244 Demineralized Water Supply Containment Isolation valve [El IS: KJ / ISV] was in the open position, resulting in an unborated water source flow path without one valve verified secured in the closed position. LCO Required Action A.1, to initiate actions to secure one valve in the flow path in the closed position, was performed immediately, and Required Action A.2, verify boron concentration is within the limit specified in the COLR, was performed within 4 hours. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as operation or condition prohibited by the plant\u0027s Technical Specifications (TS). The condition prohibited by the TS began when the unit entered Mode 6 on October 13, 2022, at 2354 hours and exited on October 25, 2022, at 1411 hours. EVENT ANALYSIS The cause of this event is inadequate procedure 3-RCS-OTS-20-001, \"Unborated Water Source Checklist,\" which is the unborated water sources surveillance procedure required to be performed in accordance with SR 3.9.2.1 to verify proper isolation of each unborated water source flow path. Specifically, the dilution flow path was no longer accounted for due to a previous change to procedure 3-RCS-OTS-20-001. REPORTABILITY AND SAFETY ASSESSMENT There were no safety consequences due to this event because the boron concentration requirements of TS 3.9.1, \"Boron Concentration,\" were met. No radiological release occurred due to this event. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as an operation or condition prohibited by the plant\u0027s Technical Specifications. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS COMPLETED Procedure 3-RCS-OTS-20-001, \"Unborated Water Source Checklist\", was revised to add additional unborated water isolations.

Abstract (Limit to 1326 spaces, i.e , approximately 13 single-spaced typewritten lines) On April 10, 2023, at 0048 EDT with Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP) Unit 3 in Mode 1 at 18 percent power, the reactor protection system was automatically actuated due to low reactor coolant flow while conducting main generator testing activities. The operators responded timely by stabilizing the plant and removing decay heat by the steam generator power operated relief valves. The cause of the event was incorrect turbine control valve logic setting which resulted in inadequate turbine speed and generator voltage. The corrective action for this event adjusted the turbine control valve logic setting to open the valves sufficiently to maintain turbine speed and generator output voltage to support house loads during operation in island mode (with the generator disconnected from the grid and supplying unit auxiliary loads). This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as a condition that resulted in automatic actuation of the reactor protection system, which tripped the reactor. VEGP Units 1, 2, and 4 were unaffected by this event.

LER NUMBER 0  050 YEAR SEQUENTIAL REV Vogtle Electric Generating Plant, Unit 3 00025 NUMBER NO. 2023 0 052 003 00 NARRATIVE EVENT DESCRIPTION On April 10, 2023, at 0048 EDT with the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP) Unit 3 in Mode 1 at 18 percent power, the Reactor Protection System (RPS) [EllS: JC] was automatically actuated during main generator system [EIIS: EL] startup testing. While performing procedure 3-ZAS-MEM-002, \"Main Generator Initial Synchronization Testing,\" with the main generator connected to the offsite power grid and supplying approximately 65 Megawatts (MW), the switchyard breakers [EIIS: FK / BKR] ZBS-161750 and ZBS-161850 were opened to disconnect the main generator from the offsite power grid and place the generator into island mode (supplying unit auxiliary loads). Shortly after placing the main generator in island mode, the turbine control system [EIIS: JJ] was not able to automatically maintain speed at the required 1800 rpm. This caused a reduction of speed and output voltage from the main generator, which resulted in a reduction in the speed of the Reactor Coolant Pumps [EIIS: AB / P]. This caused reduction in the reactor coolant flowrate, which resulted in the automatic RPS actuation. There were no structures, systems, or components that were inoperable at the beginning of the event that contributed to the event. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as a condition that resulted in automatic actuation of the RPS. EVENT ANALYSIS The cause of this event was an incorrect turbine control valve setting, which was not identified through oversight of legacy design. The turbine control valve high limit setting was not set to maintain house loads during island mode operation. The turbine control valve high limit setting was set at 7 percent, which was a default value for turbine speed control and was not sufficient to support island mode operation. The software was changed to increase the high limit setting from 7 to 25 percent to support island mode operation. SAFETY ASSESSMENT There were no safety consequences due to this event because the automatic actuation function of the RPS maintained the plant in a safe condition. The operators responded timely following the reactor trip by ensuring plant stability and decay heat was removed by steam generator power operated relief valves [EIIS: SB / PCV]. All safety systems functioned as expected as a result of the event. There were no equipment failures that contributed to the event. VEGP Units 1, 2, and 4 were unaffected by this event. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS The turbine control valve setting was corrected by a software design change to increase the setting from 7 to 25 percent.
