Abstract (Limit to 1 560 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced typewritten lines) On October 24, 2022, Vogtle Unit 3 identified that Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.9.2.1 to \"Verify one valve in each unborated water source flow path is secured in the closed position,\" was not met, placing the unit in Technical Specification Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.9.2 Condition A. The Demineralized Water Supply Containment Isolation valve 3-DWS-V244 was open, having previously been removed from procedure 3-RCS-OTS-20-001, \"Unborated Water Source Checklist,\" without adding adequate requirements for alternate isolation valves in the Chemical and Volume Control system.

LER NUMBER YEAR SEQUENTIAL REV 1Vogtle Electric Generating Plant, Unit 3 05000- NUMBER NO. \"05200025\" 2022 003 00 NARRATIVE EVENT DESCRIPTION On October 24, 2022, at 0815 EDT with the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP) Unit 3 at 0% power, in Mode 6 after completion of the initial fuel load, Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.9.2.1 verifying that one valve in each unborated water source flow path is secured in the closed position was not met. Specifically, 3-DWS-V244 Demineralized Water Supply Containment Isolation valve [El IS: KJ / ISV] was in the open position, resulting in an unborated water source flow path without one valve verified secured in the closed position. LCO Required Action A.1, to initiate actions to secure one valve in the flow path in the closed position, was performed immediately, and Required Action A.2, verify boron concentration is within the limit specified in the COLR, was performed within 4 hours. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as operation or condition prohibited by the plant\u0027s Technical Specifications (TS). The condition prohibited by the TS began when the unit entered Mode 6 on October 13, 2022, at 2354 hours and exited on October 25, 2022, at 1411 hours. EVENT ANALYSIS The cause of this event is inadequate procedure 3-RCS-OTS-20-001, \"Unborated Water Source Checklist,\" which is the unborated water sources surveillance procedure required to be performed in accordance with SR 3.9.2.1 to verify proper isolation of each unborated water source flow path. Specifically, the dilution flow path was no longer accounted for due to a previous change to procedure 3-RCS-OTS-20-001. REPORTABILITY AND SAFETY ASSESSMENT There were no safety consequences due to this event because the boron concentration requirements of TS 3.9.1, \"Boron Concentration,\" were met. No radiological release occurred due to this event. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as an operation or condition prohibited by the plant\u0027s Technical Specifications.

Abstract (Limit to 1 560 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced typewritten lines) On October 24, 2022, Vogtle Unit 3 identified that Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.9.2.1 to \"Verify one valve in each unborated water source flow path is secured in the closed position,\" was not met, placing the unit in Technical Specification Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.9.2 Condition A. The Demineralized Water Supply Containment Isolation valve 3-DWS-V244 was open, having previously been removed from procedure 3-RCS-OTS-20-001, \"Unborated Water Source Checklist,\" without adding adequate requirements for alternate isolation valves in the Chemical and Volume Control system. LCO Required Action A.1, to initiate actions to secure one valve in the flow path in the closed position, was performed immediately and Required Action A.2 was performed within 4 hours. The apparent cause of this event was that the procedure to perform SR 3.9.2.1 (3-RCS-OTS-20-001) was inadequate in ensuring unborated water sources were properly isolated. The immediate corrective action was to close and secure the valve in the flow path. Procedure 3-RCS-OTS-20-001 was revised to add the missing unborated water isolation valves. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as an operation or condition prohibited by the plant\u0027s Technical Specifications. VEGP Units 1, 2, and 4 were unaffected during this event.

Abstract (Limit to 1326 spaces, i.e , approximately 13 single-spaced typewritten lines) On April 10, 2023, at 0048 EDT with Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP) Unit 3 in Mode 1 at 18 percent power, the reactor protection system was automatically actuated due to low reactor coolant flow while conducting main generator testing activities. The operators responded timely by stabilizing the plant and removing decay heat by the steam generator power operated relief valves. The cause of the event was incorrect turbine control valve logic setting which resulted in inadequate turbine speed and generator voltage. The corrective action for this event adjusted the turbine control valve logic setting to open the valves sufficiently to maintain turbine speed and generator output voltage to support house loads during operation in island mode (with the generator disconnected from the grid and supplying unit auxiliary loads). This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as a condition that resulted in automatic actuation of the reactor protection system, which tripped the reactor. VEGP Units 1, 2, and 4 were unaffected by this event.

LER NUMBER 0  050 YEAR SEQUENTIAL REV Vogtle Electric Generating Plant, Unit 3 00025 NUMBER NO. 2023 0 052 003 00 NARRATIVE EVENT DESCRIPTION On April 10, 2023, at 0048 EDT with the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP) Unit 3 in Mode 1 at 18 percent power, the Reactor Protection System (RPS) [EllS: JC] was automatically actuated during main generator system [EIIS: EL] startup testing. While performing procedure 3-ZAS-MEM-002, \"Main Generator Initial Synchronization Testing,\" with the main generator connected to the offsite power grid and supplying approximately 65 Megawatts (MW), the switchyard breakers [EIIS: FK / BKR] ZBS-161750 and ZBS-161850 were opened to disconnect the main generator from the offsite power grid and place the generator into island mode (supplying unit auxiliary loads). Shortly after placing the main generator in island mode, the turbine control system [EIIS: JJ] was not able to automatically maintain speed at the required 1800 rpm. This caused a reduction of speed and output voltage from the main generator, which resulted in a reduction in the speed of the Reactor Coolant Pumps [EIIS: AB / P]. This caused reduction in the reactor coolant flowrate, which resulted in the automatic RPS actuation. There were no structures, systems, or components that were inoperable at the beginning of the event that contributed to the event. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as a condition that resulted in automatic actuation of the RPS. EVENT ANALYSIS The cause of this event was an incorrect turbine control valve setting, which was not identified through oversight of legacy design. The turbine control valve high limit setting was not set to maintain house loads during island mode operation. The turbine control valve high limit setting was set at 7 percent, which was a default value for turbine speed control and was not sufficient to support island mode operation. The software was changed to increase the high limit setting from 7 to 25 percent to support island mode operation. SAFETY ASSESSMENT There were no safety consequences due to this event because the automatic actuation function of the RPS maintained the plant in a safe condition. The operators responded timely following the reactor trip by ensuring plant stability and decay heat was removed by steam generator power operated relief valves [EIIS: SB / PCV]. All safety systems functioned as expected as a result of the event. There were no equipment failures that contributed to the event. VEGP Units 1, 2, and 4 were unaffected by this event. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS The turbine control valve setting was corrected by a software design change to increase the setting from 7 to 25 percent.

Abstract (Limit to 1326 spaces, i.e , approximately 13 single-spaced typewritten lines) On April 10, 2023, at 0048 EDT with Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP) Unit 3 in Mode 1 at 18 percent power, the reactor protection system was automatically actuated due to low reactor coolant flow while conducting main generator testing activities. The operators responded timely by stabilizing the plant and removing decay heat by the steam generator power operated relief valves. The cause of the event was incorrect turbine control valve logic setting which resulted in inadequate turbine speed and generator voltage. The corrective action for this event adjusted the turbine control valve logic setting to open the valves sufficiently to maintain turbine speed and generator output voltage to support house loads during operation in island mode (with the generator disconnected from the grid and supplying unit auxiliary loads). This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as a condition that resulted in automatic actuation of the reactor protection system, which tripped the reactor. VEGP Units 1, 2, and 4 were unaffected by this event.

FACILITY NAME -2. DOCKET NUMBER 3. LER NUMBER 0  050 YEAR SEQUENTIAL REV Vogtle Electric Generating Plant, Unit 3 00025 NUMBER NO. 2023 0 052 003 00 NARRATIVE EVENT DESCRIPTION On April 10, 2023, at 0048 EDT with the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP) Unit 3 in Mode 1 at 18 percent power, the Reactor Protection System (RPS) [EllS: JC] was automatically actuated during main generator system [EIIS: EL] startup testing. While performing procedure 3-ZAS-MEM-002, \"Main Generator Initial Synchronization Testing,\" with the main generator connected to the offsite power grid and supplying approximately 65 Megawatts (MW), the switchyard breakers [EIIS: FK / BKR] ZBS-161750 and ZBS-161850 were opened to disconnect the main generator from the offsite power grid and place the generator into island mode (supplying unit auxiliary loads). Shortly after placing the main generator in island mode, the turbine control system [EIIS: JJ] was not able to automatically maintain speed at the required 1800 rpm. This caused a reduction of speed and output voltage from the main generator, which resulted in a reduction in the speed of the Reactor Coolant Pumps [EIIS: AB / P]. This caused reduction in the reactor coolant flowrate, which resulted in the automatic RPS actuation. There were no structures, systems, or components that were inoperable at the beginning of the event that contributed to the event. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as a condition that resulted in automatic actuation of the RPS. EVENT ANALYSIS The cause of this event was an incorrect turbine control valve setting, which was not identified through oversight of legacy design. The turbine control valve high limit setting was not set to maintain house loads during island mode operation. The turbine control valve high limit setting was set at 7 percent, which was a default value for turbine speed control and was not sufficient to support island mode operation. The software was changed to increase the high limit setting from 7 to 25 percent to support island mode operation. SAFETY ASSESSMENT There were no safety consequences due to this event because the automatic actuation function of the RPS maintained the plant in a safe condition. The operators responded timely following the reactor trip by ensuring plant stability and decay heat was removed by steam generator power operated relief valves [EIIS: SB / PCV]. All safety systems functioned as expected as a result of the event. There were no equipment failures that contributed to the event. VEGP Units 1, 2, and 4 were unaffected by this event. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS The turbine control valve setting was corrected by a software design change to increase the setting from 7 to 25 percent.

Abstract (Limit to 1560 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced typewritten lines) The non-essential Service Water (SW) automatic isolation function ensures adequate intake canal inventory can be maintained by the emergency service water pumps following a design basis accident. This is accomplished using intake canal level probes which will isolate the non-essential equipment once the canal level drops below a predetermined level. On 3/22/2022 during routine testing, 2 of the 4 probes failed their response time test. The probes were cleaned, retested satisfactory, and returned to service. The cause of the test failure was determined to be biofouling. There were no safety consequences since an engineering analysis concluded that the intake canal level and inventory would have been sufficient to support all accident analysis assumptions.  Planned corrective actions include increased testing to monitor the biofouling buildup and the continued testing of probe coatings to reduce the biofouling. This event is being reported as a condition prohibited by the stations\u0027 Technical Specifications and a common cause failure.

Surry Power Station Unit 1 280 2022 001 00 NARRATIVE Plant Operating Conditions Prior to the Event Both units operating at 100% 1.0 Description of Event The non-essential Service Water (SW) automatic isolation function [EMS: JE, KG] ensures adequate intake canal inventory can be maintained by the emergency service water pumps [EllS: BI, P] following a design basis loss of coolant accident (LOCA) with a coincident loss of offsite power (LOOP). This function is designed to actuate when any three of the four intake canal level probes [EIIS: JE, LE] sense water level drop from the normal 28-foot level past a fixed level point of 23.5 feet. The probes are required to actuate in 55 seconds or less to ensure that the automatic logic initiates prior to the intake canal level dropping to 23 feet under all design basis scenarios. The 23-foot level is the initial condition used in the accident analyses. The four (4) intake canal level probes are routinely cleaned and inspected from April to October. This is based on the typical period that the colonial hydroids grow in the service water system, plus some buffer time on either side of that time range. Typically, the probes are found clean during the April and May cleanings and found clean in the September and October cleanings. Although there is some variance from year to year, in general, this cleaning period has worked best for the discovery and removal of colonial hydroids. On 3/22/2022, the 18-month channel 1 and channel 4 [EMS: JE, CHA] intake canal level probe calibrations were both scheduled. They were scheduled and performed sequentially. Both probes had been installed approximately 18 months earlier (channel 1 on 7/10/2020 and channel 4 on 7/15/2020). The channel 1 probe was tested first and produced an as found response time of 106 seconds. This was greater than the 55 second acceptance criteria. The probe was inspected and cleaned per the calibration procedure. Minimal fouling was noted (recorded as 0%-5% and hydroid-free). The actuation settings were checked per the calibration procedure. No adjustments were made, and no problems were found. The probe was retested in accordance with the calibration procedure and produced a satisfactory response time of 38 seconds. Following this completed calibration, the channel 4 probe was tested, with an as-found response time of 119 seconds. The probe was inspected and cleaned per the calibration procedure. Minimal fouling was noted (also recorded as 0%-5% and hydroid-free). The actuation settings were checked per the calibration procedure. No adjustments were made, and no problems were found. The probe was retested in accordance with the procedure and had a satisfactory response time of 53 seconds. Since a satisfactory response time was obtained on each probe with no actions performed, other than the cleaning, it was concluded that the slow time response on each probe was due to the common cause of biofouling. Since biofouling is a phenomenon that requires a period of a few days to become established, it is likely that the biofouling existed on both probes for a period exceeding 72 hours prior to the test.

The channel 3 probe had been time response tested with satisfactory results (10-15 seconds) on 3/2/2022. The channel 2 probe was time response tested with satisfactory results (17 seconds) on 4/19/2022. Reportability A review of each individual probe test (on 3/22/2022) showed that in both cases, the Technical Specification (TS) actions taken were appropriate based on a time of discovery failure determination. However, when the tests are taken in aggregate and assessed against the reporting requirements delineated in NUREG-1022, Rev. 3, \"Event Report Guidelines 10 CFR 50.72 and 50.73,\" it was concluded that both probes were likely inoperable prior to their time of discovery and that the station had operated in a condition prohibited by the TS; Consequently, this report is being submitted pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B). This report is also being reported pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(vii)(D) as a common cause inoperability of independent trains or channels, i.e., a single cause resulted in two independent probe channels to become inoperable in a single system designed to mitigate the consequences of an accident. 2.0 Significant Safety Consequences and Implications To determine the potential impact of the slow time response on the non-essential SW automatic isolation function, Engineering performed an evaluation to determine the intake canal minimum level that would have resulted from the slow time responses measured on 3/22/2022. This evaluation assessed the operating conditions present during the interval from the last cleaning (10/5/2021) to the time of the calibration tests (3/22/2022). The analysis concluded that the intake canal level and inventory would have been sufficient to support all accident analysis assumptions even if all four probes were conservatively assumed to actuate at the slowest of the four as found measured response times. In other words, the non-essential service water would have isolated prior to the intake canal level dropping below the assumed initial condition level of 23 feet. Additionally, intake canal level is also monitored by an independent system that provides level indication and high/low level alarms in the main control room. In the event of loss of intake canal level, station procedures direct corrective/ mitigative actions, including isolation of non-essential SW. In summary, this event resulted in no safety consequences or significant implications and the health and safety of the public was not affected at any time. 3.0 Cause of the Event Since both intake canal level probes produced a satisfactory response time with no actions other than being cleaned, it has been concluded that the cause of the event was due to the material that was removed when cleaned. Observations indicate a muddy film that is suspected of being biofouling noted on both probes.

Abstract  (Limit to 1560 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced typewritten lines) On October 22, 2022, at 0003 eastern daylight time, during power descension for the upcoming Unit 1 refueling outage, main control room operators initiated a manual turbine trip in accordance with operating procedures. At this time, Main Steam Throttle Valve 2 (TV-2), associated with the high-pressure turbine and turbine trip function failed to close. The valve remained open until 0250 when it closed on its own. The closure took less than 1 second to travel from full open to full closed with no actions taken by Operations or Maintenance personnel, to induce a closure. During the event, steam dumps assumed the remaining steam load from the turbine, as seen by a rise in steam dump demand. Based on the rise in steam dump demand, reduction to 0 megawatts electric, and all other turbine valves verified closed, the turbine was determined to be tripped. TV-2 was inoperable from October 22, 2022, at 0003 until 0013 when the unit exited the Mode of Applicability. Visual inspections were performed during valve disassembly. There were no visual indications as to why the valve failed to close during the turbine trip. Pending completion of requested failure analysis, the most likely cause of valve failure is mechanical binding of one or more valve components. The valve and the associated actuator were replaced to correct the condition. Once the failure analysis is obtained, new actions will be initiated in the corrective action program to address the likelihood of future similar events, if required.

Plant Operating Conditions Before the Event At the time of the event, Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN) Unit 1 was in Mode 1 at approximately 24 percent rated thermal power preparing for a refueling outage. II. Description of Event A. Event Summary: On October 22, 2022, at 0003 eastern daylight time (EDT), during power descension for the upcoming refueling outage, main control room (MCR) operators initiated a manual turbine trip in accordance with operating procedures. At this time, Main Steam [EIIS: SB] Throttle Valve-2 (TV-2) [EIIS: FCV], associated with the high-pressure turbine [EIIS: TRB] and turbine trip [EIIS: JJ] function failed to close. The valve remained open until 0250 when it closed on its own. The closure took less than 1 second to travel from full open to full closed with no actions taken by Operations or Maintenance personnel, to induce a closure. During the event, steam dumps assumed the remaining steam load from the turbine, as seen by a rise in steam dump demand. Based on the rise in steam dump demand, reduction to 0 megawatts electric, and all other turbine valves verified closed, the turbine was determined to be tripped. After the turbine trip was initiated, the turbine coasted down as expected, and when requested, the main steam isolation valves (MSIVs) closed as expected with no challenges. This demonstrated that neither turbine governor valve functionality nor MSIV operability was challenged concurrently with the inoperability of TV-2. TV-2 and the associated actuator were replaced during the refueling outage. A past operability evaluation (POE) determined TV-2 was inoperable from October 22, 2022, at 0003 until 0013 when the unit exited the Mode of Applicability. The POE determined the turbine trip function requires four out of four throttle valves to close, and with TV-2 inoperable, the turbine trip function would not have been performed within the required 2.5 seconds (per the Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR)). Therefore, Surveillance Requirement 3.3.2.9 (Verify ESFAS [Engineered Safety Feature Actuation System] RESPONSE TIMES are within limit) would not have been met. This constitutes an event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of a safety function necessary to mitigate the consequences of an accident, which is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D). B. Status of structures, components, or systems that were inoperable at the start of the event and contributed to the event: No inoperable structures, components, or systems contributed to this event.

Cause of each component or system failure or personnel error: Visual inspections were performed during valve disassembly. There were no visual indications as to why the valve failed to close during the turbine trip. Pending completion of requested failure analysis, the most likely cause of valve failure is mechanical binding of one or more valve components. B. Cause(s) and circumstances for each human performance related root cause: There were no human performance related causes. IV.  Analysis of the Event: The primary functions of the Turbine Trip and Feedwater Isolation signals are to prevent damage to the turbine due to water in the steam lines, and to stop the excessive flow of feedwater into the steam generators (SGs). These Functions are necessary to mitigate the effects of a high-water level in the SGs, which could result in carryover of water into the steam lines and excessive cooldown of the primary system. Turbine Trip and Feedwater Isolation functions must be operable in Modes 1, 2, and 3 except when all main feedwater (MFW) isolation valves (MFIVs), MFW regulation valves (MFRVs), and associated MFRV bypass valves are closed or isolated by a closed manual valve when the MFW System is in operation and the turbine generator may be in operation. Turbine Trip and Feedwater Isolation is also initiated by all Functions that initiate a Safety Injection (SI) signal. Turbine trip is a required part of ESFAS as outlined in TS 3.3.2. The response time testing requirement for turbine trip is 2.5 seconds per the FSAR. TS 3.3.2 requires that the throttle valves close in 1.1 seconds (SR 3.3.2.9) so that, when combined with the other trip logic in a turbine trip signal, the overall response time testing requirement is met. The turbine trip function requires four- out-of-four throttle valves to close. During the period of inoperability, the main turbine governor valves were closed and thus also functioning to remove steam flow from the main turbine. These valves function as a series valve to the throttle valves and receive the same trip signal that is supplied to the throttle valves. These valves are not response time tested, but at the time of this event, were all functioning correctly which includes tripping closed in a similar time to the throttle valves??design time. Additionally, there was no challenge with the Feedwater Isolation function or MSIVs. With the MSIVs available, the capability existed to mitigate a cooldown event by isolating all steam supplied from the reactor to the secondary plant.

Assessment of Safety Consequences There were no actual safety consequences because of this event. After the turbine trip was initiated, the turbine coasted down as expected, and when requested, the MSIVs closed with no challenges. This demonstrated that neither turbine governor valve functionality nor MSIV operability was challenged concurrently with the inoperability of TV-2. A probabilistic risk assessment determined that increase to risk for Core Damage Frequency or Large Early Release Frequency was considered negligible. A. Availability of systems or components that could have performed the same function as the components and systems that failed during the event: With TV-2 inoperable, there were additional methods to stop steam flow to the main turbine, closure of the main turbine governor valves, and another, closure of the MSIVs. B. For events that occurred when the reactor was shut down, availability of systems or components needed to shutdown the reactor and maintain safe shutdown conditions, remove residual heat, control the release of radioactive material, or mitigate the consequences of an accident: The event did not occur when the reactor was shut down. C. For failure that rendered a train of a safety system inoperable, an estimate of the elapsed time from discovery of the failure until the train was returned to service: TV-2 was inoperable from October 22, 2022, at 0003 until 0013 when the unit exited the Mode of Applicability. VI.  Corrective Actions The event was entered into the Tennessee Valley Authority Corrective Action Program (CAP) under Condition Report 1811241. A. Immediate Corrective Actions: TV-2 and the associated actuator were replaced during refueling outage. B. Corrective Actions to Prevent Recurrence or to reduce probability of similar events occurring in the future: The valve and the associated actuator were replaced to correct the condition. Once the failure analysis is obtained, new actions will be initiated in the corrective action program to address the likelihood of future similar events, if required.

Abstract  (Limit to 1560 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced typewritten lines) On October 22, 2022, at 0003 eastern daylight time, during power descension for the upcoming Unit 1 refueling outage, main control room operators initiated a manual turbine trip in accordance with operating procedures. At this time, Main Steam Throttle Valve 2 (TV-2), associated with the high-pressure turbine and turbine trip function failed to close. The valve remained open until 0250 when it closed on its own. The closure took less than 1 second to travel from full open to full closed with no actions taken by Operations or Maintenance personnel, to induce a closure. During the event, steam dumps assumed the remaining steam load from the turbine, as seen by a rise in steam dump demand. Based on the rise in steam dump demand, reduction to 0 megawatts electric, and all other turbine valves verified closed, the turbine was determined to be tripped. TV-2 was inoperable from October 22, 2022, at 0003 until 0013 when the unit exited the Mode of Applicability. Visual inspections were performed during valve disassembly. There were no visual indications as to why the valve failed to close during the turbine trip. Pending completion of requested failure analysis, the most likely cause of valve failure is mechanical binding of one or more valve components. The valve and the associated actuator were replaced to correct the condition. Once the failure analysis is obtained, new actions will be initiated in the corrective action program to address the likelihood of future similar events, if required.

Plant Operating Conditions Before the Event At the time of the event, Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN) Unit 1 was in Mode 1 at approximately 24 percent rated thermal power preparing for a refueling outage. II. Description of Event A. Event Summary: On October 22, 2022, at 0003 eastern daylight time (EDT), during power descension for the upcoming refueling outage, main control room (MCR) operators initiated a manual turbine trip in accordance with operating procedures. At this time, Main Steam [EIIS: SB] Throttle Valve-2 (TV-2) [EIIS: FCV], associated with the high-pressure turbine [EIIS: TRB] and turbine trip [EIIS: JJ] function failed to close. The valve remained open until 0250 when it closed on its own. The closure took less than 1 second to travel from full open to full closed with no actions taken by Operations or Maintenance personnel, to induce a closure. During the event, steam dumps assumed the remaining steam load from the turbine, as seen by a rise in steam dump demand. Based on the rise in steam dump demand, reduction to 0 megawatts electric, and all other turbine valves verified closed, the turbine was determined to be tripped. After the turbine trip was initiated, the turbine coasted down as expected, and when requested, the main steam isolation valves (MSIVs) closed as expected with no challenges. This demonstrated that neither turbine governor valve functionality nor MSIV operability was challenged concurrently with the inoperability of TV-2. TV-2 and the associated actuator were replaced during the refueling outage. A past operability evaluation (POE) determined TV-2 was inoperable from October 22, 2022, at 0003 until 0013 when the unit exited the Mode of Applicability. The POE determined the turbine trip function requires four out of four throttle valves to close, and with TV-2 inoperable, the turbine trip function would not have been performed within the required 2.5 seconds (per the Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR)). Therefore, Surveillance Requirement 3.3.2.9 (Verify ESFAS [Engineered Safety Feature Actuation System] RESPONSE TIMES are within limit) would not have been met. This constitutes an event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of a safety function necessary to mitigate the consequences of an accident, which is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D). B. Status of structures, components, or systems that were inoperable at the start of the event and contributed to the event: No inoperable structures, components, or systems contributed to this event.

Abstract (Limit to 1326 spaces, i.e., approximately 13 single-spaced typewritten lines) At 0956 CST on February 1, 2023, with Joseph M. Farley Nuclear Plant (FNP) Unit 1 in Mode 1 at 100 percent power, the reactor automatically tripped following a turbine trip signal. The turbine tripped when Maintenance personnel connected portable DC ground detection equipment (DC Scout) to the positive terminal of the \"B\" train Auxiliary Building battery to locate a DC ground. Connecting the DC Scout created a jumper to the normally open contact of the Turbine Trip Solenoid. Operations stabilized the plant in Mode 3 and removed decay heat via steaming to condenser. Auxiliary Feedwater System (AFW) automatically actuated as expected in response to the reactor trip. Corrective actions include changes to risk mitigation procedures associated with detecting DC grounds and use of portable ground detection equipment. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to the automatic actuation of the Reactor Protection System (RPS) and AFW system as listed in 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B). FNP Unit 2 was not affected during this event.

FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET NUMBER 3. LER NUMBER 050 YEAR SEQUENTIAL REV Joseph M. Farley Nuclear Plant, Unit 1 348 NUMBER NO. D 2023 052 001 00 NARRATIVE EVENT DESCRIPTION On February 1, 2023, at 0956 CST, while Joseph M. Farley Nuclear Plant (FNP) Unit 1 was in Mode 1 at 100 percent power, maintenance was conducting troubleshooting to identify the source of an Auxilliary Building (AB) \"B\" Train DC ground. The ground was identified to be on the negative side of the AB Battery [EIIS / EEIS : EJ / BTRY]. When portable ground detection equipment (DC Scout) was connected to the positive terminal of the AB Battery a loss of Electro Hydraulic Control (EHC) [EIIS: TG] oil pressure occurred which resulted in a turbine trip and subsequent reactor trip. During the forced outage it was determined that the DC ground existed on a cable between the AB and Turbine Building associated with the Turbine Trip Solenoid Valve (20-ET) [EIIS / EEIS: TG / SOL]. The 20-ET solenoid valve is normally closed and energizes to open to dump EHC oil from the turbine throttle valves and governor valves. It was confirmed via troubleshooting that when maintenance connected the DC Scout to the AB Battery terminal it created a jumper in the circuit to energize the 20-ET solenoid. During the plant trip the \"1A\" 4 kV non emergency bus [EIIS : EA] failed to transfer to the \"1A\" 4 kV Startup Transformer [EIIS : EB]. This resulted in the trip of the \"A\" Reactor Coolant Pump (RCP) [EIIS / EEIS: AB / P]. The \"B\" and \"C\" RCPs remained in operation. Additionally, Auxilliary Feedwater System (AFW) [EIIS: BA] autostarted as expected post reactor trip and maintained feedwater flow to the Steam Generators (EIIS: SB). Main Feed Water (MAW) [EIIS: SJ] and the condenser [EIIS: SG] remained available for post trip decay heat removal. EVENT ANALYSIS It was determined that previous unrelated work at penetration 07-155-31 had resulted in damage to cable 1UYT0001E [EEIS : CBL4] which feeds the 20-ET solenoid. This damage inside the penetration breach was not visible and had resulted in the AB DC ground alarm. The risk of actuating equipment in the circuit while installing portable ground detection equipment was not known and led to missed opportunities in work planning and risk mitigation. The failure of the bus transfer to occur was determined to be a failure of the Time Delay Drop Out (TDDO) relay [EEIS / EIIS: El / 62] (Manufacturer: General Electric / Model: 12HGA17C52) associated with the 4 kV bus transfer circuit. REPORTABILITY AND SAFETY ASSESSMENT There were no safety consequences as result of this event. The operating crew responded appropriately to the event. This event was within the analysis of the UFSAR Chapter 15. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to the automatic actuation of the Reactor Protection System (RPS) and the AFW system as identified in 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B). CORRECTIVE ACTIONS PLANNED OR COMPLETED 1. Repaired grounded cable 1UYT0001E to 20-ET Turbine Trip Solenoid. 2. Revise maintenance and risk procedures for mitigation actions during ground detection activities and while using portable ground detection equipment. 3. Replaced the TDDO relay associated with the 1A 4 kv bus. PREVIOUS SIMILAR EVENTS There were no events from the last three years with either the same or similar cause to this event.

Abstract (Limit to 1326 spaces, i.e.. approximately 13 single-spaced typewritten lines) MANUAL REACTOR TRIP On April 5, 2023, at approximately 0651 EDT with Unit 1 in Mode 1 at 85 percent power, the reactor was manually tripped due to the loss of Main Feedwater Pump \u0027C\u0027 (FWP \u0027C\u0027) with FWP \u0027B\u0027 removed from service as a part of normal plant shutdown procedures. The turbine tripped automatically based on the reactor trip signal. Emergency Feedwater (EFW) actuation occurred as expected due to the low-low steam generator water levels which occurred as a result of the reactor trip. The reactor trip was not complex with safety systems responding normally post trip. Operations stabilized the plant in Mode 3. Decay heat was removed by the steam generators, utilizing the steam dump system. Due to the manual Reactor Protection System (RPS) actuation and the automatic actuation of the EFW system, this event is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A).

Summer Nuclear Station, Unit 1 395 2023 052 001 00 NARRATIVE 1.0 DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT On April 5, 2023, at approximately 0651 EDT with Unit 1 in Mode 1 at 85 percent power, the reactor was manually tripped due to the loss of Main Feedwater Pump \u0027C\u0027 (FWP \u0027C\u0027). FWP \u0027B\u0027 was removed from service at 0551 per the plant operating procedures. V.C. Summer Nuclear Station (VCSNS) operations had completed a power reduction to 85% per procedure at 0537 hours and generator output was 865 Mwe. The plant was stable at 85% power to meet the required conditions to support pre-outage scheduled Main Steam Safety Valve testing. These were pre-planned plant operations prior to entering Refueling Outage 27 (RF27). The turbine tripped automatically based on the reactor trip signal. Emergency Feedwater (EFW) actuation occurred as expected due to the low-low steam generator water levels which occurred as a result of the reactor trip. The reactor trip was not complex with safety systems responding normally post trip. Operations stabilized the plant in Mode 3. Decay heat was removed by the steam generators, utilizing the steam dump system. Subsequently on April 5, 2023, the decision to enter RF27 ahead of schedule was made. With FWP B\u0027 removed from service in preparation for a planned shutdown for RF27, the station was aware of the conditional risk of two feedwater pump operation, which was necessary prior to the outage. Aware of the risk, the operating crew was trained and briefed to trip the unit upon loss of one of two operating feedwater pumps in that plant condition. The crew responded accordingly and placed the plant in a safe condition, as previously had been briefed for the condition. Due to the manual Reactor Protection System (RPS) actuation and the automatic actuation of the EFW system, this event is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A). 2.0 SIGNIFICANT SAFETY CONSEQUENCES AND IMPLICATIONS The operating crew responded correctly to the event. The applicable emergency operating procedures were properly entered. and documentation met expectations. 3.0 CAUSE OF THE EVENT The apparent cause of the FWP \u0027C\u0027 trip was a combination of the following factors: improper instrumentation thresholds during the last vendor preventative maintenance evolution in 2014, normal thrust bearing wear, and change in pump performance characteristics when the \u0027B\u0027 Main Feedwater Pump was secured. Engineering analysis determined that the thrust bearing wear detector \u0027Y\u0027 clearance was set low at some time in the past, most likely during major inspection as a part of RF21 in the Spring of 2014. The FWP  thrust bearing wear detector configuration on April 5, 2023, did not allow online monitoring of thrust bearing wear oil sensing lines. 4.0 IMMEDIATE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS VCSNS entered its planned RF27 and performed a failure modes analysis to determine the FWP \u0027C\u0027 trip cause.

Summer Nuclear Station, Unit 1 395 2023 052 001 00 NARRATIVE 5.0 ADDITIONAL CORRECTIVE ACTIONS An extent of condition was performed for FWPs \u0027A\u0027 and \u0027B\u0027 thrust bearings and thrust bearing wear detectors. This extent of condition found that neither FWP \u0027A\u0027 nor \u0027B\u0027 were similarly affected by the error on the thrust bearing wear detectors. 6.0 ACTIONS TO PREVENT RECURRENCE As a final measure to mitigate the risk of a similar trip in the future, an engineering design change was implemented to install pressure gauges on both the active and the inactive thrust bearing wear detector oil sensing lines for all three Main Feedwater Pumps. This modification will allow for online monitoring of the margin to the thrust bearing wear trip setpoint. Field measurements were also taken by Design Engineering and a vendor to consider future enhancements. 7.0 SIMILAR EVENTS No similar events were identified within the last three years, where a reactor trip was required due to a feedwater malfunction. 8.0 MANUFACTURER \u0026 MODEL (OR OTHER IDENTIFICATION) General Electric DRV-631, 6 Stage, Dual Inlet, Feedwater Pump Turbine 9.0 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION None  NRC FORM 366A (03-14-2023) Page  3  of  3", "label": "title", "shape": "dot", "title": "MANUAL REACTOR TRIP DUE TO LOSS OF MAIN FEEDWATER PUMP 5  Event Date 6.

Abstract (Limit to 1560 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single spaced typewritten lines) On January 23, 2022, at 1118 hours, the \u0027B\u0027 train Charging Pump and Reactor Plant Component Cooling Water (RPCCW) Pump Area Exhaust Fan, 31-1VRTN13B, failed. This resulted in tripping its supply breaker, 32-1W(F4M), fire alarms, Control Room alarms, and an auto start of the standby fan. Because these fans support operability of the Emergency Core Cooling Systems (ECCS) and RPCCW systems, 72-hour Technical Specification Action Statements (TSAS) were entered for one ECCS subsystem and one RPCCW safety loop being inoperable. When it became evident repairs could not be completed within the Technical Specification Allowed Outage Time (TS AOT), a request was made, and approved, for a Notice Of Enforcement Discretion for 72 hours beyond the TS AOT to provide time to restore the fan and operability of ECCS and RPCCW. ECCS and RPCCW were inoperable for a total of 105 hours and 32 minutes. The cause of the fan failure was a failed motor bearing. The fan was repaired and restored to operable status on January 27, 2022 at 2050 hours. This condition is being reported pursuant to 10CFR50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as a condition prohibited by Technical Specifications.

FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET NUMBER 3. LER NUMBER YEAR SEQUENTIAL REV 05000- NUMBER NO. Millstone Power Station Unit 3 423 2022 001 00 NARRATIVE 1. EVENT DESCRIPTION On January 23, 2022, at 1118 hours, the \u0027B\u0027 train Charging Pump and Reactor Plant Component Cooling Water (RPCCW) Pump Area Exhaust Fan, 3HVR*FN13B, failed. This resulted in tripping its supply breaker, 32-1W(F4M), fire alarms, Control Room alarms, and an auto start of the standby fan. This fan provides a support function for the Charging Pumps and RPCCW Pumps, as well as supporting operation of the Auxiliary Building Filter system and Supplemental Leak Collection and Release System (SLCRS). As a result of the fan tripping, Operations personnel entered the following Technical Specification Action Statements (TSAS): ??TSAS 3.5.2.a for one Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) subsystem inoperable, which requires the inoperable subsystem to be restored to operable status within 72 hours, or the unit placed in HOT STANDBY within the next 6 hours, and HOT SHUTDOWN within the following 6 hours. ??TSAS 3.7.3 for one RPCCW safety loop inoperable, which requires the inoperable safety loop to be restored to operable status within 72 hours, or the unit placed in HOT STANDBY within the following 6 hours, and COLD SHUTDOWN within the following 30 hours. ??TSAS 3.6.6.1 for one SLCRS system inoperable, which requires the inoperable system to be restored within 7 days, or the unit placed in HOT STANDBY within the next 6 hours, and COLD SHUTDOWN within the following 30 hours. ??TSAS 3.7.9 for one Auxiliary Building Filter system inoperable, which requires the inoperable system to be restored within 7 days, or the unit placed in HOT STANDBY within the next 6 hours, and COLD SHUTDOWN within the following 30 hours. Millstone Maintenance inspected the fan and found that the motor shaft was bent, causing the fan blades to contact the housing. After the failure was identified, repair activities proceeded on a continuous basis with the goal of completing the repairs and validating operability of the fan prior to expiration of the 72-hour Allowed Outage time (AOT) of TSAS 3.5.2.a and 3.7.3. However, as corrective maintenance activities to replace the fan motor and fan hub assembly progressed, completion of the repairs was forecasted to extend beyond the original 72-hour AOT. Therefore, on January 26, 2022, at approximately 0830 hours, Dominion Energy Nuclear Connecticut (DENC) informed the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) of the need for a Notice Of Enforcement Discretion (NOED) from the requirements of TS 3.5.2 and 3.7.3 for a period of 72 hours to avoid an unnecessary shutdown while repairs were completed. The NOED request was verbally approved by the NRC on January 26, 2022, at approximately 1034 hours. On January 27, 2022, at 2050 hours, corrective maintenance and post-maintenance testing of the fan was completed satisfactorily, the TSASs were exited, and the period of Notice Of Enforcement Discretion exited. One ECCS subsystem and one RPCCW safety loop were inoperable for a total of 105 hours and 32 minutes, which exceeds the 72-hour AOT of TSAS 3.5.2.a and 3.7.3. Therefore, this event is being reported in accordance with 10CFR50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as a condition prohibited by Technical Specifications. 2. CAUSE Investigation has determined that the fan failure was caused by a motor bearing failure. The failed bearing is manufactured by FAFNIR and its model number is 314KDD BEARING.

ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES MPS3 Charging Pump and RPCCW Pump Area exhaust fan 3HVR*FN13B is safety related but does not have any direct TS requirements. However, the fan does support the charging pump and RPCCW pump and heat exchangers, as well as the Auxiliary Building Filter and SLCRS systems, which are TS equipment. Therefore, this fan affects the TS for ECCS, RPCCW, SLCRS, and Auxiliary Building Filter System. The Charging Pump and RPCCW Pump Area supply and exhaust fans are part of the Auxiliary Building Filter System (ABFS). The fans are redundant, 100% capacity each. The fans provide an environment suitable for personnel access and equipment operation. It also controls and minimizes the potential for spread of airborne radioactive material within the building. In the event of a safety injection signal (SIS) or a containment depressurization actuation (CDA) signal, the auxiliary building general area ventilation is shutdown; the building outlet isolation dampers close; the Charging Pump and RPCCW Pump Area ventilation exhaust dampers close; the auxiliary building filter unit inlet and outlet dampers open; the filter exhaust fans start automatically; and the Charging Pump and RPCCW Pump Area supply and exhaust fans continue to operate venting through the turbine building stack via the Auxiliary Building Filter System (ABFS). An SIS signal also automatically starts operation of SLCRS. During accident conditions, the ABFS and SLCRS operate together to bring the secondary containment enclosure, auxiliary building, engineered safety features (ESF) building, hydrogen re-combiner building, and the main steam valve building to negative pressure within 120 seconds. Operability of 3HVR*FN13B is required by MPS3 procedures in recognition of the potential for higher (more adverse) ambient temperatures in the area of the charging and RPCCW pumps if the exhaust fan is lost, and also as the suction air source for the ABFS. However, the fan is not included as a TS or Technical Requirements Manual (TRM) required component. Adequate heat removal has been demonstrated with an Ultimate Heat Sink temperature up to 80 \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0F (TS 3/4.7.5). During the period 3HVR*FN13B was inoperable, the service water temperature was approximately 41.8 \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0F and outside air temperatures (winter air temperatures) ensure delivered air is on the lower side of the allowed range. These service water and outside air temperatures provided substantial margin for ensuring pump cooling capacity. 3HVR*FN13A was in service providing the necessary ventilation for normal operation and as the initial condition for accident scenarios. For 3HVR*FN13B being out of service to have had an adverse effect on an analyzed transient, an event initiator would need to be combined with a failure specifically in the \u0027A\u0027 train (either 3HVR*FN13A, \u0027A\u0027 train Emergency Diesel Generator or 4160 Volt Power Supply). Margin in the current FSAR dose consequence analyses to the 10 CFR 50.67 Total Effective Dose Equivalent (TEDE) Limits is shown in the table below. This margin is available to offset the potential fora reduction in the SLCRS drawdown capability following a potential loss of both trains of ABFS. However, all forced flow releases would remain filtered by the SLCRS. During the time spent in the TSAS, including the period of enforcement discretion, the opposite train of ABFS was maintained in service. Therefore, safety margins were maintained.

FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET NUMBER 3. LER NUMBER YEAR SEQUENTIAL REV 05000- NUMBER NO. Millstone Power Station Unit 3 423 2022 001 00 NARRATIVE The System Operating Procedure for Auxiliary Building Emergency Ventilation and Exhaust (OP 3314J) provides instruction for the installation and operation of Portable Emergency Ventilation Fan, 3HVR-FN18, and a portable generator. Performance of this procedure satisfies requirements of TRM 7.4.1, Fire Related Safe Shutdown Components. This procedure is the contingency plan in the event of failure of the charging and RPCCW pump area ventilation system. Providing emergency ventilation to the Auxiliary Building in accordance with OP 3314J is modeled as a recovery action given failure of the Charging/RPCCW area ventilation system in the quantitative risk assessment. The ECCS and RPCCW systems were expected to maintain their ability to perform their safety functions during the period of enforcement discretion. No other structures, systems, or components (SSCs) were affected during the period of enforcement discretion and no limits were imposed on any SSC that hindered their ability to perform their specified function. The independence of the physical barriers to radiological releases were not degraded during the period of enforcement discretion. The planned activities on 3HVR*FN13B did not impact fuel cladding, RCS or Containment integrity. No other SSCs were affected by the proposed period of enforcement discretion, and therefore no limits were imposed on any SSC in performing their specified safety function. Based on the above, there were no safety consequences associated with 3HVR*FN13B being inoperable for a period of approximately 33.5 hours beyond the TS AOT. 4. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS The damaged motor was replaced with a spare motor from the warehouse. A like-for-like fan hub and blade assembly was used to replace the damaged hub and blade assembly. Additional corrective actions will be taken in accordance with the station Corrective Action Program. 5. PREVIOUS OCCURRENCES There have been no similar events of a fan being inoperable for longer than the TS AOT at Millstone Power Station Unit 3 in the past three years. 6.

Abstract (Limit to 1560 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single spaced typewritten lines) On January 23, 2022, at 1118 hours, the \u0027B\u0027 train Charging Pump and Reactor Plant Component Cooling Water (RPCCW) Pump Area Exhaust Fan, 31-1VRTN13B, failed. This resulted in tripping its supply breaker, 32-1W(F4M), fire alarms, Control Room alarms, and an auto start of the standby fan. Because these fans support operability of the Emergency Core Cooling Systems (ECCS) and RPCCW systems, 72-hour Technical Specification Action Statements (TSAS) were entered for one ECCS subsystem and one RPCCW safety loop being inoperable. When it became evident repairs could not be completed within the Technical Specification Allowed Outage Time (TS AOT), a request was made, and approved, for a Notice Of Enforcement Discretion for 72 hours beyond the TS AOT to provide time to restore the fan and operability of ECCS and RPCCW. ECCS and RPCCW were inoperable for a total of 105 hours and 32 minutes. The cause of the fan failure was a failed motor bearing. The fan was repaired and restored to operable status on January 27, 2022 at 2050 hours. This condition is being reported pursuant to 10CFR50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as a condition prohibited by Technical Specifications.

EVENT DESCRIPTION On January 23, 2022, at 1118 hours, the \u0027B\u0027 train Charging Pump and Reactor Plant Component Cooling Water (RPCCW) Pump Area Exhaust Fan, 3HVR*FN13B, failed. This resulted in tripping its supply breaker, 32-1W(F4M), fire alarms, Control Room alarms, and an auto start of the standby fan. This fan provides a support function for the Charging Pumps and RPCCW Pumps, as well as supporting operation of the Auxiliary Building Filter system and Supplemental Leak Collection and Release System (SLCRS). As a result of the fan tripping, Operations personnel entered the following Technical Specification Action Statements (TSAS): ??TSAS 3.5.2.a for one Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) subsystem inoperable, which requires the inoperable subsystem to be restored to operable status within 72 hours, or the unit placed in HOT STANDBY within the next 6 hours, and HOT SHUTDOWN within the following 6 hours. ??TSAS 3.7.3 for one RPCCW safety loop inoperable, which requires the inoperable safety loop to be restored to operable status within 72 hours, or the unit placed in HOT STANDBY within the following 6 hours, and COLD SHUTDOWN within the following 30 hours. ??TSAS 3.6.6.1 for one SLCRS system inoperable, which requires the inoperable system to be restored within 7 days, or the unit placed in HOT STANDBY within the next 6 hours, and COLD SHUTDOWN within the following 30 hours. ??TSAS 3.7.9 for one Auxiliary Building Filter system inoperable, which requires the inoperable system to be restored within 7 days, or the unit placed in HOT STANDBY within the next 6 hours, and COLD SHUTDOWN within the following 30 hours. Millstone Maintenance inspected the fan and found that the motor shaft was bent, causing the fan blades to contact the housing. After the failure was identified, repair activities proceeded on a continuous basis with the goal of completing the repairs and validating operability of the fan prior to expiration of the 72-hour Allowed Outage time (AOT) of TSAS 3.5.2.a and 3.7.3. However, as corrective maintenance activities to replace the fan motor and fan hub assembly progressed, completion of the repairs was forecasted to extend beyond the original 72-hour AOT. Therefore, on January 26, 2022, at approximately 0830 hours, Dominion Energy Nuclear Connecticut (DENC) informed the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) of the need for a Notice Of Enforcement Discretion (NOED) from the requirements of TS 3.5.2 and 3.7.3 for a period of 72 hours to avoid an unnecessary shutdown while repairs were completed. The NOED request was verbally approved by the NRC on January 26, 2022, at approximately 1034 hours. On January 27, 2022, at 2050 hours, corrective maintenance and post-maintenance testing of the fan was completed satisfactorily, the TSASs were exited, and the period of Notice Of Enforcement Discretion exited. One ECCS subsystem and one RPCCW safety loop were inoperable for a total of 105 hours and 32 minutes, which exceeds the 72-hour AOT of TSAS 3.5.2.a and 3.7.3. Therefore, this event is being reported in accordance with 10CFR50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as a condition prohibited by Technical Specifications. 2. CAUSE Investigation has determined that the fan failure was caused by a motor bearing failure. The failed bearing is manufactured by FAFNIR and its model number is 314KDD BEARING.

Millstone Power Station - Unit 3 423 q 052 2023 003 00 NARRATIVE On October 11, 2023 at 1252 hours, with Millstone Power Station Unit 3 in Mode 1 at 100 percent reactor power, it was identified during response time testing in accordance with surveillance SP 3443E42, \"Rakset 4 RCS Narrow Range RTD Time Response\", that the reactor coolant system (RCS) loop 4 narrow range hot leg resistance temperature detector (RTD), 3RCS*TE441C, did not meet its response time acceptance criteria. AOP 3571, \"Abnormal Operating Procedure\", was entered at 1427 hours and the actions of Attachment A, \"RCS Narrow Range Temperature Channel Failure\", were performed. Technical Specification (TS) 3.3.1 action 6A and TS 3.3.2 action 20 were entered and the associated reactor protection system (RPS) bistables were placed in the trip condition. Required TS actions were completed on October 11, 2023 at 1517 hours. The temperature indicated by 3RCS*TE441C (Computer Point RCS-T441G) was consistent with the other two narrow range hot leg RTDs in loop 4. The trend of 3RCS*TE441C indicated diminished variation compared to other 11 narrow range hot leg temperature computer points beginning in June of 2022. Based on this trend it was determined that the 3RCS*TE441C slow response time had existed for longer than allowed by plant\u0027s technical specifications. On October 16 2023 at 1638, in accordance with SP 3442B04, \"Hot Leg RTD Failure Compensation Procedure\", 3RCS*TE441C was removed from the circuit and in its place, a biased average of the other two RTDs was inserted. The remaining two hot leg RTDs plus the biased signal returned the loop to operable, and bistables were restored to service. TS 3.3.1 action 6A and TS 3.3.2 action 20 were exited. During the Millstone Unit 3 refueling outage in October 2023, 3RCS*TE441C was found not fully inserted into its thermowell. The RTD was successfully replaced, calibrated, and response time tested in accordance with of surveillance SP 3443E42. Technical Specification 3.3.1 action 6A for Mode 1 and 2 states that with the number of operable channels one less than the total number of channels, during startup and/or power operation, may proceed provided following conditions are satisfied. (a) The inoperable channel is placed in tripped condition within 72 hours and (B) minimum channel operable requirement is met. Technical Specification 3.3.2 action 20 for Mode 1 and 2 states that with the number of operable channels one less than the total number of channels, during startup and/or power operation, may proceed provided following conditions are satisfied. (a) The inoperable channel is placed in tripped condition within 6 hours and (B) minimum channel operable requirement is met. This condition is reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant\u0027s technical specifications.

Millstone Power Station - Unit 3 423 2023 052 003 00 NARRATIVE ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES The RCS has three thermowells on each of the four reactor coolant system hot leg loops, and each thermowell houses one dual-element resistance temperature detector (RTD). 3RCS*TE441C senses narrow range hot leg temperature in conjunction with 3RCS*TE441A and 3RCS*TE441D. All three hot leg RTDs, along with a single RTD located in the cold leg of the same RCS loop feed into delta T and Tavg circuitry, in this case supplying signals to RAKSET 4. If 3RCS*TE441C is deemed inoperable, the entire Delta T/Tavg protection circuit would be impacted in RAKSET 4 potentially impacting the response of the overpower delta T (OPAT) and overtemperature delta T (OTAT) trip functions. Each of the other 3 RCS loops have identical and independent instrumentation to the other 3 protection channels. A reactor trip is generated when 2 of the 4 independent channels reach a trip condition. Most of the Chapter 15 safety analysis events that credit the action of the OPAT or OTAT trips are symmetric events in which the behavior of each RCS loop is essentially identical to the behavior of the other RCS loops. In these cases, the potentially degraded behavior of the single loop containing 3RCS*TE441C would not affect the timing of a reactor trip. For events that do not have symmetric loop behavior, the main steam line break (MSLB) shows the greatest loop to loop differences in temperature response. The event presented in Chapter 15 of the final safety analysis report (FSAR) is the limiting MSLB event which is initialized from zero power conditions. As part of the sensitivity studies confirming the limiting nature of the zero power case, an analysis was performed to demonstrate that the MSLB initiated from full power conditions was less limiting. This full power analysis examined a spectrum of break sizes, some of which resulted in an OPAT trip to terminate the event. As expected, the OPAT RCS loop with the break reached the trip condition first. However, as this is just a single channel, a reactor trip did not occur. Of the remaining 3 loops, the next two fastest responding reached an OPAT condition within 0.1 seconds of each other. Therefore, assuming a break occurs in the steam line attached to the RCS loop with 3RCS*TE441C invalidating that loops OPAT trip, an OPAT trip would be delayed at most 0.1 seconds until the next two loops were both in a tripped condition. There is more than adequate margin between the hot full power case results and the event acceptance criteria that the zero power case presented in the FSAR would still be limiting. Therefore, the safety functions provided by the temperature inputs to the reactor protection system was maintained despite the single hot leg RTD, 3RCS*TE441C, not meeting its response time acceptance criteria.

Millstone Power Station - Unit 3 423 2023 052 003 00 NARRATIVE ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES The RCS has three thermowells on each of the four reactor coolant system hot leg loops, and each thermowell houses one dual-element resistance temperature detector (RTD). 3RCS*TE441C senses narrow range hot leg temperature in conjunction with 3RCS*TE441A and 3RCS*TE441D. All three hot leg RTDs, along with a single RTD located in the cold leg of the same RCS loop feed into delta T and Tavg circuitry, in this case supplying signals to RAKSET 4. If 3RCS*TE441C is deemed inoperable, the entire Delta T/Tavg protection circuit would be impacted in RAKSET 4 potentially impacting the response of the overpower delta T (OPAT) and overtemperature delta T (OTAT) trip functions. Each of the other 3 RCS loops have identical and independent instrumentation to the other 3 protection channels. A reactor trip is generated when 2 of the 4 independent channels reach a trip condition. Most of the Chapter 15 safety analysis events that credit the action of the OPAT or OTAT trips are symmetric events in which the behavior of each RCS loop is essentially identical to the behavior of the other RCS loops. In these cases, the potentially degraded behavior of the single loop containing 3RCS*TE441C would not affect the timing of a reactor trip. For events that do not have symmetric loop behavior, the main steam line break (MSLB) shows the greatest loop to loop differences in temperature response. The event presented in Chapter 15 of the final safety analysis report (FSAR) is the limiting MSLB event which is initialized from zero power conditions. As part of the sensitivity studies confirming the limiting nature of the zero power case, an analysis was performed to demonstrate that the MSLB initiated from full power conditions was less limiting. This full power analysis examined a spectrum of break sizes, some of which resulted in an OPAT trip to terminate the event. As expected, the OPAT RCS loop with the break reached the trip condition first. However, as this is just a single channel, a reactor trip did not occur. Of the remaining 3 loops, the next two fastest responding reached an OPAT condition within 0.1 seconds of each other. Therefore, assuming a break occurs in the steam line attached to the RCS loop with 3RCS*TE441C invalidating that loops OPAT trip, an OPAT trip would be delayed at most 0.1 seconds until the next two loops were both in a tripped condition. There is more than adequate margin between the hot full power case results and the event acceptance criteria that the zero power case presented in the FSAR would still be limiting. Therefore, the safety functions provided by the temperature inputs to the reactor protection system was maintained despite the single hot leg RTD, 3RCS*TE441C, not meeting its response time acceptance criteria.

Event Description On May 3, 2022 at 15:41 EDT, with Unit 1 in Mode 1 and 100 percent power, the Control Room Operators observed lowering steam generator water levels and manually tripped the reactor. The lowering steam generator levels were caused by a malfunction of the 1B Main Feed Pump control system [JK]. The trip was not complex, and all systems responded normally post trip. The components that failed were General Electric IS420UCSBH1A control modules. There were no Structures, Systems, or Components (SSCs) that were out of service at the beginning of the event that contributed to the event. Due to the actuation of the Reactor Protection System (RPS)[JC] and the actuation of the Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW)[BA] System, this event is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A). B. Cause of Event The cause of the event was a failure of the 1B Main Feed Pump control system which caused the pump to slow down, resulting in lowering main feedwater flow to the steam generators. C. Safety Assessment The Main Feed Pumps [SJ] serve no safety-related function for the unit. When the Operators manually tripped the plant, all the appropriate safety systems responded as designed. The AFW system actuated as designed and all control rods [AA] fully inserted into the core. The operating crew performed as expected. The event was within the analysis of the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report, Chapter 15, and there was no release of radioactivity. This event did not pose a threat to the health and safety of the public, therefore the safety significance of this issue is very low. D. Corrective Actions The control system for the Main Feed Pump was repaired. E. Previous Similar Events None.

There were no Structures, Systems, or Components (SSCs) that were out of service at the beginning of the event that contributed to the event. Due to the actuation of the Reactor Protection System (RPS)[JC] and the actuation of the Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW)[BA] System, this event is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A). B. Cause of Event The cause of the event was a failure of the 1B Main Feed Pump control system which caused the pump to slow down, resulting in lowering main feedwater flow to the steam generators. C. Safety Assessment The Main Feed Pumps [SJ] serve no safety-related function for the unit. When the Operators manually tripped the plant, all the appropriate safety systems responded as designed. The AFW system actuated as designed and all control rods [AA] fully inserted into the core. The operating crew performed as expected. The event was within the analysis of the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report, Chapter 15, and there was no release of radioactivity. This event did not pose a threat to the health and safety of the public, therefore the safety significance of this issue is very low. D. Corrective Actions The control system for the Main Feed Pump was repaired. E. Previous Similar Events None.

Abstract (Limit to 1 560 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced typewritten lines) On October 24, 2022, Vogtle Unit 3 identified that Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.9.2.1 to \"Verify one valve in each unborated water source flow path is secured in the closed position,\" was not met, placing the unit in Technical Specification Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.9.2 Condition A. The Demineralized Water Supply Containment Isolation valve 3-DWS-V244 was open, having previously been removed from procedure 3-RCS-OTS-20-001, \"Unborated Water Source Checklist,\" without adding adequate requirements for alternate isolation valves in the Chemical and Volume Control system. LCO Required Action A.1, to initiate actions to secure one valve in the flow path in the closed position, was performed immediately and Required Action A.2 was performed within 4 hours. The apparent cause of this event was that the procedure to perform SR 3.9.2.1 (3-RCS-OTS-20-001) was inadequate in ensuring unborated water sources were properly isolated. The immediate corrective action was to close and secure the valve in the flow path. Procedure 3-RCS-OTS-20-001 was revised to add the missing unborated water isolation valves. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as an operation or condition prohibited by the plant\u0027s Technical Specifications. VEGP Units 1, 2, and 4 were unaffected during this event.

LER NUMBER YEAR SEQUENTIAL REV 1Vogtle Electric Generating Plant, Unit 3 05000- NUMBER NO. \"05200025\" 2022 003 00 NARRATIVE EVENT DESCRIPTION On October 24, 2022, at 0815 EDT with the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP) Unit 3 at 0% power, in Mode 6 after completion of the initial fuel load, Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.9.2.1 verifying that one valve in each unborated water source flow path is secured in the closed position was not met. Specifically, 3-DWS-V244 Demineralized Water Supply Containment Isolation valve [El IS: KJ / ISV] was in the open position, resulting in an unborated water source flow path without one valve verified secured in the closed position. LCO Required Action A.1, to initiate actions to secure one valve in the flow path in the closed position, was performed immediately, and Required Action A.2, verify boron concentration is within the limit specified in the COLR, was performed within 4 hours. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as operation or condition prohibited by the plant\u0027s Technical Specifications (TS). The condition prohibited by the TS began when the unit entered Mode 6 on October 13, 2022, at 2354 hours and exited on October 25, 2022, at 1411 hours. EVENT ANALYSIS The cause of this event is inadequate procedure 3-RCS-OTS-20-001, \"Unborated Water Source Checklist,\" which is the unborated water sources surveillance procedure required to be performed in accordance with SR 3.9.2.1 to verify proper isolation of each unborated water source flow path. Specifically, the dilution flow path was no longer accounted for due to a previous change to procedure 3-RCS-OTS-20-001. REPORTABILITY AND SAFETY ASSESSMENT There were no safety consequences due to this event because the boron concentration requirements of TS 3.9.1, \"Boron Concentration,\" were met. No radiological release occurred due to this event. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as an operation or condition prohibited by the plant\u0027s Technical Specifications. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS COMPLETED Procedure 3-RCS-OTS-20-001, \"Unborated Water Source Checklist\", was revised to add additional unborated water isolations.

Abstract (Limit to 1326 spaces, i.e , approximately 13 single-spaced typewritten lines) On April 10, 2023, at 0048 EDT with Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP) Unit 3 in Mode 1 at 18 percent power, the reactor protection system was automatically actuated due to low reactor coolant flow while conducting main generator testing activities. The operators responded timely by stabilizing the plant and removing decay heat by the steam generator power operated relief valves. The cause of the event was incorrect turbine control valve logic setting which resulted in inadequate turbine speed and generator voltage. The corrective action for this event adjusted the turbine control valve logic setting to open the valves sufficiently to maintain turbine speed and generator output voltage to support house loads during operation in island mode (with the generator disconnected from the grid and supplying unit auxiliary loads). This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as a condition that resulted in automatic actuation of the reactor protection system, which tripped the reactor. VEGP Units 1, 2, and 4 were unaffected by this event.

LER NUMBER 0  050 YEAR SEQUENTIAL REV Vogtle Electric Generating Plant, Unit 3 00025 NUMBER NO. 2023 0 052 003 00 NARRATIVE EVENT DESCRIPTION On April 10, 2023, at 0048 EDT with the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP) Unit 3 in Mode 1 at 18 percent power, the Reactor Protection System (RPS) [EllS: JC] was automatically actuated during main generator system [EIIS: EL] startup testing. While performing procedure 3-ZAS-MEM-002, \"Main Generator Initial Synchronization Testing,\" with the main generator connected to the offsite power grid and supplying approximately 65 Megawatts (MW), the switchyard breakers [EIIS: FK / BKR] ZBS-161750 and ZBS-161850 were opened to disconnect the main generator from the offsite power grid and place the generator into island mode (supplying unit auxiliary loads). Shortly after placing the main generator in island mode, the turbine control system [EIIS: JJ] was not able to automatically maintain speed at the required 1800 rpm. This caused a reduction of speed and output voltage from the main generator, which resulted in a reduction in the speed of the Reactor Coolant Pumps [EIIS: AB / P]. This caused reduction in the reactor coolant flowrate, which resulted in the automatic RPS actuation. There were no structures, systems, or components that were inoperable at the beginning of the event that contributed to the event. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as a condition that resulted in automatic actuation of the RPS. EVENT ANALYSIS The cause of this event was an incorrect turbine control valve setting, which was not identified through oversight of legacy design. The turbine control valve high limit setting was not set to maintain house loads during island mode operation. The turbine control valve high limit setting was set at 7 percent, which was a default value for turbine speed control and was not sufficient to support island mode operation. The software was changed to increase the high limit setting from 7 to 25 percent to support island mode operation. SAFETY ASSESSMENT There were no safety consequences due to this event because the automatic actuation function of the RPS maintained the plant in a safe condition. The operators responded timely following the reactor trip by ensuring plant stability and decay heat was removed by steam generator power operated relief valves [EIIS: SB / PCV]. All safety systems functioned as expected as a result of the event. There were no equipment failures that contributed to the event. VEGP Units 1, 2, and 4 were unaffected by this event. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS The turbine control valve setting was corrected by a software design change to increase the setting from 7 to 25 percent.

Abstract (Limit to 1560 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced typewritten lines) The non-essential Service Water (SW) automatic isolation function ensures adequate intake canal inventory can be maintained by the emergency service water pumps following a design basis accident. This is accomplished using intake canal level probes which will isolate the non-essential equipment once the canal level drops below a predetermined level. On 3/22/2022 during routine testing, 2 of the 4 probes failed their response time test. The probes were cleaned, retested satisfactory, and returned to service. The cause of the test failure was determined to be biofouling. There were no safety consequences since an engineering analysis concluded that the intake canal level and inventory would have been sufficient to support all accident analysis assumptions.  Planned corrective actions include increased testing to monitor the biofouling buildup and the continued testing of probe coatings to reduce the biofouling. This event is being reported as a condition prohibited by the stations\u0027 Technical Specifications and a common cause failure.

Surry Power Station Unit 1 280 2022 001 00 NARRATIVE Plant Operating Conditions Prior to the Event Both units operating at 100% 1.0 Description of Event The non-essential Service Water (SW) automatic isolation function [EMS: JE, KG] ensures adequate intake canal inventory can be maintained by the emergency service water pumps [EllS: BI, P] following a design basis loss of coolant accident (LOCA) with a coincident loss of offsite power (LOOP). This function is designed to actuate when any three of the four intake canal level probes [EIIS: JE, LE] sense water level drop from the normal 28-foot level past a fixed level point of 23.5 feet. The probes are required to actuate in 55 seconds or less to ensure that the automatic logic initiates prior to the intake canal level dropping to 23 feet under all design basis scenarios. The 23-foot level is the initial condition used in the accident analyses. The four (4) intake canal level probes are routinely cleaned and inspected from April to October. This is based on the typical period that the colonial hydroids grow in the service water system, plus some buffer time on either side of that time range. Typically, the probes are found clean during the April and May cleanings and found clean in the September and October cleanings. Although there is some variance from year to year, in general, this cleaning period has worked best for the discovery and removal of colonial hydroids. On 3/22/2022, the 18-month channel 1 and channel 4 [EMS: JE, CHA] intake canal level probe calibrations were both scheduled. They were scheduled and performed sequentially. Both probes had been installed approximately 18 months earlier (channel 1 on 7/10/2020 and channel 4 on 7/15/2020). The channel 1 probe was tested first and produced an as found response time of 106 seconds. This was greater than the 55 second acceptance criteria. The probe was inspected and cleaned per the calibration procedure. Minimal fouling was noted (recorded as 0%-5% and hydroid-free). The actuation settings were checked per the calibration procedure. No adjustments were made, and no problems were found. The probe was retested in accordance with the calibration procedure and produced a satisfactory response time of 38 seconds. Following this completed calibration, the channel 4 probe was tested, with an as-found response time of 119 seconds. The probe was inspected and cleaned per the calibration procedure. Minimal fouling was noted (also recorded as 0%-5% and hydroid-free). The actuation settings were checked per the calibration procedure. No adjustments were made, and no problems were found. The probe was retested in accordance with the procedure and had a satisfactory response time of 53 seconds. Since a satisfactory response time was obtained on each probe with no actions performed, other than the cleaning, it was concluded that the slow time response on each probe was due to the common cause of biofouling. Since biofouling is a phenomenon that requires a period of a few days to become established, it is likely that the biofouling existed on both probes for a period exceeding 72 hours prior to the test.

FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET NUMBER 3. LER NUMBER YEAR SEQUENTIAL REV 05000- NUMBER NO. Surry Power Station Unit 1 280 2022 001 00 NARRATIVE The probes were last cleaned and inspected on 10/5/2021. The channel 3 probe had been time response tested with satisfactory results (10-15 seconds) on 3/2/2022. The channel 2 probe was time response tested with satisfactory results (17 seconds) on 4/19/2022. Reportability A review of each individual probe test (on 3/22/2022) showed that in both cases, the Technical Specification (TS) actions taken were appropriate based on a time of discovery failure determination. However, when the tests are taken in aggregate and assessed against the reporting requirements delineated in NUREG-1022, Rev. 3, \"Event Report Guidelines 10 CFR 50.72 and 50.73,\" it was concluded that both probes were likely inoperable prior to their time of discovery and that the station had operated in a condition prohibited by the TS; Consequently, this report is being submitted pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B). This report is also being reported pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(vii)(D) as a common cause inoperability of independent trains or channels, i.e., a single cause resulted in two independent probe channels to become inoperable in a single system designed to mitigate the consequences of an accident. 2.0 Significant Safety Consequences and Implications To determine the potential impact of the slow time response on the non-essential SW automatic isolation function, Engineering performed an evaluation to determine the intake canal minimum level that would have resulted from the slow time responses measured on 3/22/2022. This evaluation assessed the operating conditions present during the interval from the last cleaning (10/5/2021) to the time of the calibration tests (3/22/2022). The analysis concluded that the intake canal level and inventory would have been sufficient to support all accident analysis assumptions even if all four probes were conservatively assumed to actuate at the slowest of the four as found measured response times. In other words, the non-essential service water would have isolated prior to the intake canal level dropping below the assumed initial condition level of 23 feet. Additionally, intake canal level is also monitored by an independent system that provides level indication and high/low level alarms in the main control room. In the event of loss of intake canal level, station procedures direct corrective/ mitigative actions, including isolation of non-essential SW. In summary, this event resulted in no safety consequences or significant implications and the health and safety of the public was not affected at any time. 3.0 Cause of the Event Since both intake canal level probes produced a satisfactory response time with no actions other than being cleaned, it has been concluded that the cause of the event was due to the material that was removed when cleaned. Observations indicate a muddy film that is suspected of being biofouling noted on both probes.

Once the fouling was removed, the response time testing was found to be satisfactory. The channel 1 probe retested at 38 seconds and the channel 4 probe retested at 53 seconds. These response times are comparable to response times measured during bench testing (i.e., when clean). 4.0 Immediate Corrective Action The probes were cleaned, retested, and returned to service. 5.0 Additional Corrective Actions On 4/21/2022, all four intake canal probes were inspected and cleaned as part of the routine April to October cleaning cycle. 6.0 Planned Corrective Actions 1. Several new coatings are being tested to reduce the biofouling material buildup. The performance of these probes and coatings will be monitored throughout the summer and winter seasons for effectiveness. 2. The cleaning frequency will be changed from April to October, which was based on calendar months, to year-round until the cause of the biofouling is better understood. 7.0 Similar Events 1.

Abstract  (Limit to 1560 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced typewritten lines) On October 22, 2022, at 0003 eastern daylight time, during power descension for the upcoming Unit 1 refueling outage, main control room operators initiated a manual turbine trip in accordance with operating procedures. At this time, Main Steam Throttle Valve 2 (TV-2), associated with the high-pressure turbine and turbine trip function failed to close. The valve remained open until 0250 when it closed on its own. The closure took less than 1 second to travel from full open to full closed with no actions taken by Operations or Maintenance personnel, to induce a closure. During the event, steam dumps assumed the remaining steam load from the turbine, as seen by a rise in steam dump demand. Based on the rise in steam dump demand, reduction to 0 megawatts electric, and all other turbine valves verified closed, the turbine was determined to be tripped. TV-2 was inoperable from October 22, 2022, at 0003 until 0013 when the unit exited the Mode of Applicability. Visual inspections were performed during valve disassembly. There were no visual indications as to why the valve failed to close during the turbine trip. Pending completion of requested failure analysis, the most likely cause of valve failure is mechanical binding of one or more valve components. The valve and the associated actuator were replaced to correct the condition. Once the failure analysis is obtained, new actions will be initiated in the corrective action program to address the likelihood of future similar events, if required.

Plant Operating Conditions Before the Event At the time of the event, Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN) Unit 1 was in Mode 1 at approximately 24 percent rated thermal power preparing for a refueling outage. II. Description of Event A. Event Summary: On October 22, 2022, at 0003 eastern daylight time (EDT), during power descension for the upcoming refueling outage, main control room (MCR) operators initiated a manual turbine trip in accordance with operating procedures. At this time, Main Steam [EIIS: SB] Throttle Valve-2 (TV-2) [EIIS: FCV], associated with the high-pressure turbine [EIIS: TRB] and turbine trip [EIIS: JJ] function failed to close. The valve remained open until 0250 when it closed on its own. The closure took less than 1 second to travel from full open to full closed with no actions taken by Operations or Maintenance personnel, to induce a closure. During the event, steam dumps assumed the remaining steam load from the turbine, as seen by a rise in steam dump demand. Based on the rise in steam dump demand, reduction to 0 megawatts electric, and all other turbine valves verified closed, the turbine was determined to be tripped. After the turbine trip was initiated, the turbine coasted down as expected, and when requested, the main steam isolation valves (MSIVs) closed as expected with no challenges. This demonstrated that neither turbine governor valve functionality nor MSIV operability was challenged concurrently with the inoperability of TV-2. TV-2 and the associated actuator were replaced during the refueling outage. A past operability evaluation (POE) determined TV-2 was inoperable from October 22, 2022, at 0003 until 0013 when the unit exited the Mode of Applicability. The POE determined the turbine trip function requires four out of four throttle valves to close, and with TV-2 inoperable, the turbine trip function would not have been performed within the required 2.5 seconds (per the Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR)). Therefore, Surveillance Requirement 3.3.2.9 (Verify ESFAS [Engineered Safety Feature Actuation System] RESPONSE TIMES are within limit) would not have been met. This constitutes an event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of a safety function necessary to mitigate the consequences of an accident, which is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D). B. Status of structures, components, or systems that were inoperable at the start of the event and contributed to the event: No inoperable structures, components, or systems contributed to this event.

MCR operators performed a manual reactor trip for the refueling outage. As expected, this induced a feedwater isolation satisfying 0013 Technical Specification (TS) Table 3.3.2-1, Function 5.b, Footnote (i) for exiting the Mode of Applicability. 0250 TV-2 closed taking less than 1 second. TV-2 and the associated actuator were replaced during refueling 10/31/22 outage. D. Manufacturer and model number of each component that failed during the event: The failed component was a flow control valve, double plug, manufactured by Westinghouse Electric Corporation, part number: 725J732, serial number: TD 75588-19. E. Other systems or secondary functions affected: There were no other systems or secondary functions affected by this event. F. Method of discovery of each component or system failure or procedural error: MCR operators identified the valve failed to close through MCR indication. This was confirmed locally by an operator. G. Failure mode, mechanism, and effect of each failed component: The most likely failure mode was mechanical binding caused by thermal expansion. H. Operator actions: MCR operators identified the valve failed to close through MCR indication. After verifying the turbine was tripped, MCR operators continued to conduct a plant shutdown in accordance with plant procedures I. Automatically and manually initiated safety system responses: None.

Cause of each component or system failure or personnel error: Visual inspections were performed during valve disassembly. There were no visual indications as to why the valve failed to close during the turbine trip. Pending completion of requested failure analysis, the most likely cause of valve failure is mechanical binding of one or more valve components. B. Cause(s) and circumstances for each human performance related root cause: There were no human performance related causes. IV.  Analysis of the Event: The primary functions of the Turbine Trip and Feedwater Isolation signals are to prevent damage to the turbine due to water in the steam lines, and to stop the excessive flow of feedwater into the steam generators (SGs). These Functions are necessary to mitigate the effects of a high-water level in the SGs, which could result in carryover of water into the steam lines and excessive cooldown of the primary system. Turbine Trip and Feedwater Isolation functions must be operable in Modes 1, 2, and 3 except when all main feedwater (MFW) isolation valves (MFIVs), MFW regulation valves (MFRVs), and associated MFRV bypass valves are closed or isolated by a closed manual valve when the MFW System is in operation and the turbine generator may be in operation. Turbine Trip and Feedwater Isolation is also initiated by all Functions that initiate a Safety Injection (SI) signal. Turbine trip is a required part of ESFAS as outlined in TS 3.3.2. The response time testing requirement for turbine trip is 2.5 seconds per the FSAR. TS 3.3.2 requires that the throttle valves close in 1.1 seconds (SR 3.3.2.9) so that, when combined with the other trip logic in a turbine trip signal, the overall response time testing requirement is met. The turbine trip function requires four- out-of-four throttle valves to close. During the period of inoperability, the main turbine governor valves were closed and thus also functioning to remove steam flow from the main turbine. These valves function as a series valve to the throttle valves and receive the same trip signal that is supplied to the throttle valves. These valves are not response time tested, but at the time of this event, were all functioning correctly which includes tripping closed in a similar time to the throttle valves??design time. Additionally, there was no challenge with the Feedwater Isolation function or MSIVs. With the MSIVs available, the capability existed to mitigate a cooldown event by isolating all steam supplied from the reactor to the secondary plant.

Assessment of Safety Consequences There were no actual safety consequences because of this event. After the turbine trip was initiated, the turbine coasted down as expected, and when requested, the MSIVs closed with no challenges. This demonstrated that neither turbine governor valve functionality nor MSIV operability was challenged concurrently with the inoperability of TV-2. A probabilistic risk assessment determined that increase to risk for Core Damage Frequency or Large Early Release Frequency was considered negligible. A. Availability of systems or components that could have performed the same function as the components and systems that failed during the event: With TV-2 inoperable, there were additional methods to stop steam flow to the main turbine, closure of the main turbine governor valves, and another, closure of the MSIVs. B. For events that occurred when the reactor was shut down, availability of systems or components needed to shutdown the reactor and maintain safe shutdown conditions, remove residual heat, control the release of radioactive material, or mitigate the consequences of an accident: The event did not occur when the reactor was shut down. C. For failure that rendered a train of a safety system inoperable, an estimate of the elapsed time from discovery of the failure until the train was returned to service: TV-2 was inoperable from October 22, 2022, at 0003 until 0013 when the unit exited the Mode of Applicability. VI.  Corrective Actions The event was entered into the Tennessee Valley Authority Corrective Action Program (CAP) under Condition Report 1811241. A. Immediate Corrective Actions: TV-2 and the associated actuator were replaced during refueling outage. B. Corrective Actions to Prevent Recurrence or to reduce probability of similar events occurring in the future: The valve and the associated actuator were replaced to correct the condition. Once the failure analysis is obtained, new actions will be initiated in the corrective action program to address the likelihood of future similar events, if required.

Abstract (Limit to 1326 spaces, i.e., approximately 13 single-spaced typewritten lines) At 0956 CST on February 1, 2023, with Joseph M. Farley Nuclear Plant (FNP) Unit 1 in Mode 1 at 100 percent power, the reactor automatically tripped following a turbine trip signal. The turbine tripped when Maintenance personnel connected portable DC ground detection equipment (DC Scout) to the positive terminal of the \"B\" train Auxiliary Building battery to locate a DC ground. Connecting the DC Scout created a jumper to the normally open contact of the Turbine Trip Solenoid. Operations stabilized the plant in Mode 3 and removed decay heat via steaming to condenser. Auxiliary Feedwater System (AFW) automatically actuated as expected in response to the reactor trip. Corrective actions include changes to risk mitigation procedures associated with detecting DC grounds and use of portable ground detection equipment. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to the automatic actuation of the Reactor Protection System (RPS) and AFW system as listed in 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B). FNP Unit 2 was not affected during this event.

FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET NUMBER 3. LER NUMBER 050 YEAR SEQUENTIAL REV Joseph M. Farley Nuclear Plant, Unit 1 348 NUMBER NO. D 2023 052 001 00 NARRATIVE EVENT DESCRIPTION On February 1, 2023, at 0956 CST, while Joseph M. Farley Nuclear Plant (FNP) Unit 1 was in Mode 1 at 100 percent power, maintenance was conducting troubleshooting to identify the source of an Auxilliary Building (AB) \"B\" Train DC ground. The ground was identified to be on the negative side of the AB Battery [EIIS / EEIS : EJ / BTRY]. When portable ground detection equipment (DC Scout) was connected to the positive terminal of the AB Battery a loss of Electro Hydraulic Control (EHC) [EIIS: TG] oil pressure occurred which resulted in a turbine trip and subsequent reactor trip. During the forced outage it was determined that the DC ground existed on a cable between the AB and Turbine Building associated with the Turbine Trip Solenoid Valve (20-ET) [EIIS / EEIS: TG / SOL]. The 20-ET solenoid valve is normally closed and energizes to open to dump EHC oil from the turbine throttle valves and governor valves. It was confirmed via troubleshooting that when maintenance connected the DC Scout to the AB Battery terminal it created a jumper in the circuit to energize the 20-ET solenoid. During the plant trip the \"1A\" 4 kV non emergency bus [EIIS : EA] failed to transfer to the \"1A\" 4 kV Startup Transformer [EIIS : EB]. This resulted in the trip of the \"A\" Reactor Coolant Pump (RCP) [EIIS / EEIS: AB / P]. The \"B\" and \"C\" RCPs remained in operation. Additionally, Auxilliary Feedwater System (AFW) [EIIS: BA] autostarted as expected post reactor trip and maintained feedwater flow to the Steam Generators (EIIS: SB). Main Feed Water (MAW) [EIIS: SJ] and the condenser [EIIS: SG] remained available for post trip decay heat removal. EVENT ANALYSIS It was determined that previous unrelated work at penetration 07-155-31 had resulted in damage to cable 1UYT0001E [EEIS : CBL4] which feeds the 20-ET solenoid. This damage inside the penetration breach was not visible and had resulted in the AB DC ground alarm. The risk of actuating equipment in the circuit while installing portable ground detection equipment was not known and led to missed opportunities in work planning and risk mitigation. The failure of the bus transfer to occur was determined to be a failure of the Time Delay Drop Out (TDDO) relay [EEIS / EIIS: El / 62] (Manufacturer: General Electric / Model: 12HGA17C52) associated with the 4 kV bus transfer circuit. REPORTABILITY AND SAFETY ASSESSMENT There were no safety consequences as result of this event. The operating crew responded appropriately to the event. This event was within the analysis of the UFSAR Chapter 15. This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to the automatic actuation of the Reactor Protection System (RPS) and the AFW system as identified in 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B). CORRECTIVE ACTIONS PLANNED OR COMPLETED 1. Repaired grounded cable 1UYT0001E to 20-ET Turbine Trip Solenoid. 2. Revise maintenance and risk procedures for mitigation actions during ground detection activities and while using portable ground detection equipment. 3. Replaced the TDDO relay associated with the 1A 4 kv bus. PREVIOUS SIMILAR EVENTS There were no events from the last three years with either the same or similar cause to this event.

Abstract (Limit to 1326 spaces, i.e.. approximately 13 single-spaced typewritten lines) MANUAL REACTOR TRIP On April 5, 2023, at approximately 0651 EDT with Unit 1 in Mode 1 at 85 percent power, the reactor was manually tripped due to the loss of Main Feedwater Pump \u0027C\u0027 (FWP \u0027C\u0027) with FWP \u0027B\u0027 removed from service as a part of normal plant shutdown procedures. The turbine tripped automatically based on the reactor trip signal. Emergency Feedwater (EFW) actuation occurred as expected due to the low-low steam generator water levels which occurred as a result of the reactor trip. The reactor trip was not complex with safety systems responding normally post trip. Operations stabilized the plant in Mode 3. Decay heat was removed by the steam generators, utilizing the steam dump system. Due to the manual Reactor Protection System (RPS) actuation and the automatic actuation of the EFW system, this event is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A).

Summer Nuclear Station, Unit 1 395 2023 052 001 00 NARRATIVE 1.0 DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT On April 5, 2023, at approximately 0651 EDT with Unit 1 in Mode 1 at 85 percent power, the reactor was manually tripped due to the loss of Main Feedwater Pump \u0027C\u0027 (FWP \u0027C\u0027). FWP \u0027B\u0027 was removed from service at 0551 per the plant operating procedures. V.C. Summer Nuclear Station (VCSNS) operations had completed a power reduction to 85% per procedure at 0537 hours and generator output was 865 Mwe. The plant was stable at 85% power to meet the required conditions to support pre-outage scheduled Main Steam Safety Valve testing. These were pre-planned plant operations prior to entering Refueling Outage 27 (RF27). The turbine tripped automatically based on the reactor trip signal. Emergency Feedwater (EFW) actuation occurred as expected due to the low-low steam generator water levels which occurred as a result of the reactor trip. The reactor trip was not complex with safety systems responding normally post trip. Operations stabilized the plant in Mode 3. Decay heat was removed by the steam generators, utilizing the steam dump system. Subsequently on April 5, 2023, the decision to enter RF27 ahead of schedule was made. With FWP B\u0027 removed from service in preparation for a planned shutdown for RF27, the station was aware of the conditional risk of two feedwater pump operation, which was necessary prior to the outage. Aware of the risk, the operating crew was trained and briefed to trip the unit upon loss of one of two operating feedwater pumps in that plant condition. The crew responded accordingly and placed the plant in a safe condition, as previously had been briefed for the condition. Due to the manual Reactor Protection System (RPS) actuation and the automatic actuation of the EFW system, this event is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A). 2.0 SIGNIFICANT SAFETY CONSEQUENCES AND IMPLICATIONS The operating crew responded correctly to the event. The applicable emergency operating procedures were properly entered. and documentation met expectations. 3.0 CAUSE OF THE EVENT The apparent cause of the FWP \u0027C\u0027 trip was a combination of the following factors: improper instrumentation thresholds during the last vendor preventative maintenance evolution in 2014, normal thrust bearing wear, and change in pump performance characteristics when the \u0027B\u0027 Main Feedwater Pump was secured. Engineering analysis determined that the thrust bearing wear detector \u0027Y\u0027 clearance was set low at some time in the past, most likely during major inspection as a part of RF21 in the Spring of 2014. The FWP  thrust bearing wear detector configuration on April 5, 2023, did not allow online monitoring of thrust bearing wear oil sensing lines. 4.0 IMMEDIATE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS VCSNS entered its planned RF27 and performed a failure modes analysis to determine the FWP \u0027C\u0027 trip cause.

Summer Nuclear Station, Unit 1 395 2023 052 001 00 NARRATIVE 5.0 ADDITIONAL CORRECTIVE ACTIONS An extent of condition was performed for FWPs \u0027A\u0027 and \u0027B\u0027 thrust bearings and thrust bearing wear detectors. This extent of condition found that neither FWP \u0027A\u0027 nor \u0027B\u0027 were similarly affected by the error on the thrust bearing wear detectors. 6.0 ACTIONS TO PREVENT RECURRENCE As a final measure to mitigate the risk of a similar trip in the future, an engineering design change was implemented to install pressure gauges on both the active and the inactive thrust bearing wear detector oil sensing lines for all three Main Feedwater Pumps. This modification will allow for online monitoring of the margin to the thrust bearing wear trip setpoint. Field measurements were also taken by Design Engineering and a vendor to consider future enhancements. 7.0 SIMILAR EVENTS No similar events were identified within the last three years, where a reactor trip was required due to a feedwater malfunction. 8.0 MANUFACTURER \u0026 MODEL (OR OTHER IDENTIFICATION) General Electric DRV-631, 6 Stage, Dual Inlet, Feedwater Pump Turbine 9.0 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION None  NRC FORM 366A (03-14-2023) Page  3  of  3"}, {"arrows": "to", "from": "3952023001R00", "to": "clause: 50.73.(a)(2)(i)(B)"}, {"arrows": "to", "from": "4002021004R00", "to": "Event: {\u0027What happened\u0027: \u0027The lift setting of pressurizer safety valve (PSV) 1RC-123 at Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1 (HNP), was found to be -1.3 percent (%) from its setpoint, which is outside the Technical Specification (TS) allowed tolerance of +/-1%.\u0027}"}, {"arrows": "to", "from": "Event: {\u0027What happened\u0027: \u0027The lift setting of pressurizer safety valve (PSV) 1RC-123 at Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1 (HNP), was found to be -1.3 percent (%) from its setpoint, which is outside the Technical Specification (TS) allowed tolerance of +/-1%.\u0027}", "to": "Cause: {\u0027Why did it happen\u0027: \u0027The PSV lift setting being out of tolerance was due to a personnel error that resulted in the inadvertent installation of a valve that had previously demonstrated setpoint drift incompatible with TS criteria.\u0027}"}, {"arrows": "to", "from": "Cause: {\u0027Why did it happen\u0027: \u0027The PSV lift setting being out of tolerance was due to a personnel error that resulted in the inadvertent installation of a valve that had previously demonstrated setpoint drift incompatible with TS criteria.\u0027}", "to": "Influence: {\u0027What was the impact\u0027: \"The event had no significance with respect to the health and safety of the public as the as-found PSV lift setting of -1.3% is well within the safety analysis.

Abstract (Limit to 1560 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single spaced typewritten lines) On January 23, 2022, at 1118 hours, the \u0027B\u0027 train Charging Pump and Reactor Plant Component Cooling Water (RPCCW) Pump Area Exhaust Fan, 31-1VRTN13B, failed. This resulted in tripping its supply breaker, 32-1W(F4M), fire alarms, Control Room alarms, and an auto start of the standby fan. Because these fans support operability of the Emergency Core Cooling Systems (ECCS) and RPCCW systems, 72-hour Technical Specification Action Statements (TSAS) were entered for one ECCS subsystem and one RPCCW safety loop being inoperable. When it became evident repairs could not be completed within the Technical Specification Allowed Outage Time (TS AOT), a request was made, and approved, for a Notice Of Enforcement Discretion for 72 hours beyond the TS AOT to provide time to restore the fan and operability of ECCS and RPCCW. ECCS and RPCCW were inoperable for a total of 105 hours and 32 minutes. The cause of the fan failure was a failed motor bearing. The fan was repaired and restored to operable status on January 27, 2022 at 2050 hours. This condition is being reported pursuant to 10CFR50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as a condition prohibited by Technical Specifications.

EVENT DESCRIPTION On January 23, 2022, at 1118 hours, the \u0027B\u0027 train Charging Pump and Reactor Plant Component Cooling Water (RPCCW) Pump Area Exhaust Fan, 3HVR*FN13B, failed. This resulted in tripping its supply breaker, 32-1W(F4M), fire alarms, Control Room alarms, and an auto start of the standby fan. This fan provides a support function for the Charging Pumps and RPCCW Pumps, as well as supporting operation of the Auxiliary Building Filter system and Supplemental Leak Collection and Release System (SLCRS). As a result of the fan tripping, Operations personnel entered the following Technical Specification Action Statements (TSAS): ??TSAS 3.5.2.a for one Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) subsystem inoperable, which requires the inoperable subsystem to be restored to operable status within 72 hours, or the unit placed in HOT STANDBY within the next 6 hours, and HOT SHUTDOWN within the following 6 hours. ??TSAS 3.7.3 for one RPCCW safety loop inoperable, which requires the inoperable safety loop to be restored to operable status within 72 hours, or the unit placed in HOT STANDBY within the following 6 hours, and COLD SHUTDOWN within the following 30 hours. ??TSAS 3.6.6.1 for one SLCRS system inoperable, which requires the inoperable system to be restored within 7 days, or the unit placed in HOT STANDBY within the next 6 hours, and COLD SHUTDOWN within the following 30 hours. ??TSAS 3.7.9 for one Auxiliary Building Filter system inoperable, which requires the inoperable system to be restored within 7 days, or the unit placed in HOT STANDBY within the next 6 hours, and COLD SHUTDOWN within the following 30 hours. Millstone Maintenance inspected the fan and found that the motor shaft was bent, causing the fan blades to contact the housing. After the failure was identified, repair activities proceeded on a continuous basis with the goal of completing the repairs and validating operability of the fan prior to expiration of the 72-hour Allowed Outage time (AOT) of TSAS 3.5.2.a and 3.7.3. However, as corrective maintenance activities to replace the fan motor and fan hub assembly progressed, completion of the repairs was forecasted to extend beyond the original 72-hour AOT. Therefore, on January 26, 2022, at approximately 0830 hours, Dominion Energy Nuclear Connecticut (DENC) informed the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) of the need for a Notice Of Enforcement Discretion (NOED) from the requirements of TS 3.5.2 and 3.7.3 for a period of 72 hours to avoid an unnecessary shutdown while repairs were completed. The NOED request was verbally approved by the NRC on January 26, 2022, at approximately 1034 hours. On January 27, 2022, at 2050 hours, corrective maintenance and post-maintenance testing of the fan was completed satisfactorily, the TSASs were exited, and the period of Notice Of Enforcement Discretion exited. One ECCS subsystem and one RPCCW safety loop were inoperable for a total of 105 hours and 32 minutes, which exceeds the 72-hour AOT of TSAS 3.5.2.a and 3.7.3. Therefore, this event is being reported in accordance with 10CFR50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as a condition prohibited by Technical Specifications. 2. CAUSE Investigation has determined that the fan failure was caused by a motor bearing failure. The failed bearing is manufactured by FAFNIR and its model number is 314KDD BEARING.

ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES MPS3 Charging Pump and RPCCW Pump Area exhaust fan 3HVR*FN13B is safety related but does not have any direct TS requirements. However, the fan does support the charging pump and RPCCW pump and heat exchangers, as well as the Auxiliary Building Filter and SLCRS systems, which are TS equipment. Therefore, this fan affects the TS for ECCS, RPCCW, SLCRS, and Auxiliary Building Filter System. The Charging Pump and RPCCW Pump Area supply and exhaust fans are part of the Auxiliary Building Filter System (ABFS). The fans are redundant, 100% capacity each. The fans provide an environment suitable for personnel access and equipment operation. It also controls and minimizes the potential for spread of airborne radioactive material within the building. In the event of a safety injection signal (SIS) or a containment depressurization actuation (CDA) signal, the auxiliary building general area ventilation is shutdown; the building outlet isolation dampers close; the Charging Pump and RPCCW Pump Area ventilation exhaust dampers close; the auxiliary building filter unit inlet and outlet dampers open; the filter exhaust fans start automatically; and the Charging Pump and RPCCW Pump Area supply and exhaust fans continue to operate venting through the turbine building stack via the Auxiliary Building Filter System (ABFS). An SIS signal also automatically starts operation of SLCRS. During accident conditions, the ABFS and SLCRS operate together to bring the secondary containment enclosure, auxiliary building, engineered safety features (ESF) building, hydrogen re-combiner building, and the main steam valve building to negative pressure within 120 seconds. Operability of 3HVR*FN13B is required by MPS3 procedures in recognition of the potential for higher (more adverse) ambient temperatures in the area of the charging and RPCCW pumps if the exhaust fan is lost, and also as the suction air source for the ABFS. However, the fan is not included as a TS or Technical Requirements Manual (TRM) required component. Adequate heat removal has been demonstrated with an Ultimate Heat Sink temperature up to 80 \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0F (TS 3/4.7.5). During the period 3HVR*FN13B was inoperable, the service water temperature was approximately 41.8 \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0F and outside air temperatures (winter air temperatures) ensure delivered air is on the lower side of the allowed range. These service water and outside air temperatures provided substantial margin for ensuring pump cooling capacity. 3HVR*FN13A was in service providing the necessary ventilation for normal operation and as the initial condition for accident scenarios. For 3HVR*FN13B being out of service to have had an adverse effect on an analyzed transient, an event initiator would need to be combined with a failure specifically in the \u0027A\u0027 train (either 3HVR*FN13A, \u0027A\u0027 train Emergency Diesel Generator or 4160 Volt Power Supply). Margin in the current FSAR dose consequence analyses to the 10 CFR 50.67 Total Effective Dose Equivalent (TEDE) Limits is shown in the table below. This margin is available to offset the potential fora reduction in the SLCRS drawdown capability following a potential loss of both trains of ABFS. However, all forced flow releases would remain filtered by the SLCRS. During the time spent in the TSAS, including the period of enforcement discretion, the opposite train of ABFS was maintained in service. Therefore, safety margins were maintained.

FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET NUMBER 3. LER NUMBER YEAR SEQUENTIAL REV 05000- NUMBER NO. Millstone Power Station Unit 3 423 2022 001 00 NARRATIVE The System Operating Procedure for Auxiliary Building Emergency Ventilation and Exhaust (OP 3314J) provides instruction for the installation and operation of Portable Emergency Ventilation Fan, 3HVR-FN18, and a portable generator. Performance of this procedure satisfies requirements of TRM 7.4.1, Fire Related Safe Shutdown Components. This procedure is the contingency plan in the event of failure of the charging and RPCCW pump area ventilation system. Providing emergency ventilation to the Auxiliary Building in accordance with OP 3314J is modeled as a recovery action given failure of the Charging/RPCCW area ventilation system in the quantitative risk assessment. The ECCS and RPCCW systems were expected to maintain their ability to perform their safety functions during the period of enforcement discretion. No other structures, systems, or components (SSCs) were affected during the period of enforcement discretion and no limits were imposed on any SSC that hindered their ability to perform their specified function. The independence of the physical barriers to radiological releases were not degraded during the period of enforcement discretion. The planned activities on 3HVR*FN13B did not impact fuel cladding, RCS or Containment integrity. No other SSCs were affected by the proposed period of enforcement discretion, and therefore no limits were imposed on any SSC in performing their specified safety function. Based on the above, there were no safety consequences associated with 3HVR*FN13B being inoperable for a period of approximately 33.5 hours beyond the TS AOT. 4. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS The damaged motor was replaced with a spare motor from the warehouse. A like-for-like fan hub and blade assembly was used to replace the damaged hub and blade assembly. Additional corrective actions will be taken in accordance with the station Corrective Action Program. 5. PREVIOUS OCCURRENCES There have been no similar events of a fan being inoperable for longer than the TS AOT at Millstone Power Station Unit 3 in the past three years. 6.

Abstract (Limit to 1326 spaces, i.e., approximately 13 single-spaced typewritten lines) On October 11, 2023 at 1252 hours, with Millstone Power Station Unit 3 in Mode 1 at 100 percent reactor power, it was identified during technical specification required response time testing that one of three reactor coolant system (RCS) loop 4 narrow range hot leg resistance temperature detector (RTD), 3RCS*TE441C, did  not meet its response time acceptance criteria. Investigation revealed that this condition had existed for the operating cycle. 3RCS*TE441C was found not fully inserted into the thermowell due to a loose coupling nut. The RTD was successfully replaced, calibrated, and response time tested. This condition is being reported pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as any operation or condition prohibited by the plant\u0027s Technical Specifications.

Millstone Power Station - Unit 3 423 q 052 2023 003 00 NARRATIVE On October 11, 2023 at 1252 hours, with Millstone Power Station Unit 3 in Mode 1 at 100 percent reactor power, it was identified during response time testing in accordance with surveillance SP 3443E42, \"Rakset 4 RCS Narrow Range RTD Time Response\", that the reactor coolant system (RCS) loop 4 narrow range hot leg resistance temperature detector (RTD), 3RCS*TE441C, did not meet its response time acceptance criteria. AOP 3571, \"Abnormal Operating Procedure\", was entered at 1427 hours and the actions of Attachment A, \"RCS Narrow Range Temperature Channel Failure\", were performed. Technical Specification (TS) 3.3.1 action 6A and TS 3.3.2 action 20 were entered and the associated reactor protection system (RPS) bistables were placed in the trip condition. Required TS actions were completed on October 11, 2023 at 1517 hours. The temperature indicated by 3RCS*TE441C (Computer Point RCS-T441G) was consistent with the other two narrow range hot leg RTDs in loop 4. The trend of 3RCS*TE441C indicated diminished variation compared to other 11 narrow range hot leg temperature computer points beginning in June of 2022. Based on this trend it was determined that the 3RCS*TE441C slow response time had existed for longer than allowed by plant\u0027s technical specifications. On October 16 2023 at 1638, in accordance with SP 3442B04, \"Hot Leg RTD Failure Compensation Procedure\", 3RCS*TE441C was removed from the circuit and in its place, a biased average of the other two RTDs was inserted. The remaining two hot leg RTDs plus the biased signal returned the loop to operable, and bistables were restored to service. TS 3.3.1 action 6A and TS 3.3.2 action 20 were exited. During the Millstone Unit 3 refueling outage in October 2023, 3RCS*TE441C was found not fully inserted into its thermowell. The RTD was successfully replaced, calibrated, and response time tested in accordance with of surveillance SP 3443E42. Technical Specification 3.3.1 action 6A for Mode 1 and 2 states that with the number of operable channels one less than the total number of channels, during startup and/or power operation, may proceed provided following conditions are satisfied. (a) The inoperable channel is placed in tripped condition within 72 hours and (B) minimum channel operable requirement is met. Technical Specification 3.3.2 action 20 for Mode 1 and 2 states that with the number of operable channels one less than the total number of channels, during startup and/or power operation, may proceed provided following conditions are satisfied. (a) The inoperable channel is placed in tripped condition within 6 hours and (B) minimum channel operable requirement is met. This condition is reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant\u0027s technical specifications. CAUSE 3RCS*TE441C was found not fully inserted into the thermowell due to a loose coupling nut. The cause of the coupling nut becoming loose is unknown.

Millstone Power Station - Unit 3 423 2023 052 003 00 NARRATIVE ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES The RCS has three thermowells on each of the four reactor coolant system hot leg loops, and each thermowell houses one dual-element resistance temperature detector (RTD). 3RCS*TE441C senses narrow range hot leg temperature in conjunction with 3RCS*TE441A and 3RCS*TE441D. All three hot leg RTDs, along with a single RTD located in the cold leg of the same RCS loop feed into delta T and Tavg circuitry, in this case supplying signals to RAKSET 4. If 3RCS*TE441C is deemed inoperable, the entire Delta T/Tavg protection circuit would be impacted in RAKSET 4 potentially impacting the response of the overpower delta T (OPAT) and overtemperature delta T (OTAT) trip functions. Each of the other 3 RCS loops have identical and independent instrumentation to the other 3 protection channels. A reactor trip is generated when 2 of the 4 independent channels reach a trip condition. Most of the Chapter 15 safety analysis events that credit the action of the OPAT or OTAT trips are symmetric events in which the behavior of each RCS loop is essentially identical to the behavior of the other RCS loops. In these cases, the potentially degraded behavior of the single loop containing 3RCS*TE441C would not affect the timing of a reactor trip. For events that do not have symmetric loop behavior, the main steam line break (MSLB) shows the greatest loop to loop differences in temperature response. The event presented in Chapter 15 of the final safety analysis report (FSAR) is the limiting MSLB event which is initialized from zero power conditions. As part of the sensitivity studies confirming the limiting nature of the zero power case, an analysis was performed to demonstrate that the MSLB initiated from full power conditions was less limiting. This full power analysis examined a spectrum of break sizes, some of which resulted in an OPAT trip to terminate the event. As expected, the OPAT RCS loop with the break reached the trip condition first. However, as this is just a single channel, a reactor trip did not occur. Of the remaining 3 loops, the next two fastest responding reached an OPAT condition within 0.1 seconds of each other. Therefore, assuming a break occurs in the steam line attached to the RCS loop with 3RCS*TE441C invalidating that loops OPAT trip, an OPAT trip would be delayed at most 0.1 seconds until the next two loops were both in a tripped condition. There is more than adequate margin between the hot full power case results and the event acceptance criteria that the zero power case presented in the FSAR would still be limiting. Therefore, the safety functions provided by the temperature inputs to the reactor protection system was maintained despite the single hot leg RTD, 3RCS*TE441C, not meeting its response time acceptance criteria.

Abstract (Limit to 15613 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced typewritten lines) On May 3, 2022 at 15:41 EDT, with Unit 1 in Mode 1 and 100 percent power, the Control Room Operators observed lowering steam generator water levels and manually tripped the reactor. The lowering steam generator levels were caused by a malfunction of the 1B Main Feed Pump control system. The trip was not complex, and all systems responded normally post trip. The Operators stabilized the plant in Mode 3, and decay heat was removed by the steam generators, through the steam dumps to the condenser. Unit 2 was not affected. The operating crew performed as expected. The Main Feed Pump control system was repaired and the unit was restarted. Due to the manual Reactor Protection System (RPS) actuation and the automatic actuation of Auxiliary Feedwater (AFVV) System, this event is being reported under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A).

Event Description On May 3, 2022 at 15:41 EDT, with Unit 1 in Mode 1 and 100 percent power, the Control Room Operators observed lowering steam generator water levels and manually tripped the reactor. The lowering steam generator levels were caused by a malfunction of the 1B Main Feed Pump control system [JK]. The trip was not complex, and all systems responded normally post trip. The components that failed were General Electric IS420UCSBH1A control modules. There were no Structures, Systems, or Components (SSCs) that were out of service at the beginning of the event that contributed to the event. Due to the actuation of the Reactor Protection System (RPS)[JC] and the actuation of the Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW)[BA] System, this event is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A). B. Cause of Event The cause of the event was a failure of the 1B Main Feed Pump control system which caused the pump to slow down, resulting in lowering main feedwater flow to the steam generators. C. Safety Assessment The Main Feed Pumps [SJ] serve no safety-related function for the unit. When the Operators manually tripped the plant, all the appropriate safety systems responded as designed. The AFW system actuated as designed and all control rods [AA] fully inserted into the core. The operating crew performed as expected. The event was within the analysis of the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report, Chapter 15, and there was no release of radioactivity. This event did not pose a threat to the health and safety of the public, therefore the safety significance of this issue is very low. D. Corrective Actions The control system for the Main Feed Pump was repaired. E. Previous Similar Events None.
